Actual delete is not performed.\n\nIn contrast to most API's, doing a DELETE in Vamp takes a request body that designates what part of the deployment should be deleted. This allows you to remove specific services, clusters of the whole deployment.\n\n  \nDELETE on deployment with an empty request body will not delete anything.\n  \n\nThe most common way to specify what you want to delete is by exporting the target deployment as a blueprint using the ?as_blueprint=true parameter.

The lifter configuration specifies items that Vamp should run on startup. No items are included by default in reference.conf, these need to be added in application.conf.

You can override settings in the configuration files using Vamp environment variables or Java/JVM system properties. Vamp configuration is built in layers following this order:\n\nreference.conf - part of the Vamp code. Contains generic, default settings. Not a full configuration.\napplication.conf - adds environment specifics to the generic reference.conf defaults.\nJava system properties - advised for advanced use only.\nEnvironment variables - override all other settings.\n\nOn this page:\n\nOverride specific configuration parameters\nUse a custom application.conf file\nParameterize application.conf\nInclude configuration not intended for Vamp\nAccess configuration parameters through the API\n\n Override specific configuration parameters\nYou can override specific parameters set in the application.conf and reference.conf configuration files using Vamp environment variables or Java/JVM system properties. It is advisable to use environment variables when overriding specific parameters.\n\nEnvironment variables\nEnvironment variables override all other settings. Convert the configuration parameter name to upper case and replace all non-alphanumerics with an underscore `.  So, vamp.gateway-driver.timeout becomes VAMPGATEWAYDRIVERTIMEOUT`.  \n\nFor example, to change the vamp.info.message you would set the environment variable VAMPINFOMESSAGE :\n\ndocker run --net=host \\\n           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n           -v docker-machine ssh default \"which docker\":/bin/docker \\\n           -v \"/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup\" \\\n           -e \"DOCKERHOSTIP=$(docker-machine ip default)\" \\\n           -e \"VAMPINFOMESSAGE=hey YOU! \" \\\n           magneticio/vamp-docker:0.9.2\n\n Java system properties\nConfiguration by system properties is advised for advanced use only. Overriding specific settings can be best handled using environment variables. If you require extensive customisation, consider creating a new docker image with a custom application.conf file. For example:\n\nexport VAMPINFOMESSAGE=Hello # overriding Vamp info message (vamp.info.message)\n\njava -Dvamp.gateway-driver.host=localhost \\\n     -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml \\\n     -Dconfig.file=application.conf \\\n     -jar vamp.jar\n\nUse a custom application.conf file\nFor more extensive customisations, you can create a new Docker image, extending one of the provided Vamp images with a custom application.conf file. The below example explains the steps for creating a Docker image with a custom DCOS config, if you are using a different container management platform you should use the associated application.conf and adjust the Docker file accordingly.\n\nCopy application.conf (github.com/magneticio - Vamp DCOS application.conf)\nAdjust as required. Check the list of configuration settings (below) for details of the available optionsa\nCreate a Dockerfile with the lines:  \n  FROM magneticio/vamp-dcos:0.9.2  \n  ADD application.conf /usr/local/vamp/conf/\nBuild the image with docker build --tag username/vamp\n\n Parameterize application.conf\n\nTo avoid duplication of configuration and make it easier to overwrite specific settings you can define global variables outside the vamp   stanza, at the top of application.conf. \n\nFor example:\nvamp_host = \"localhost\"    # Default value\nvamphost = $   # If environment variable exists, use this value\n\nvamp  \n    timeout = 3 seconds\n     \n \n\nThis is as of 0.9.2 how we configure our DC/OS Docker image\n\n(Typesafe documentation on the topic covering system or env variable overrides)[https://github.com/typesafehub/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides]\n\nInclude configuration not intended for Vamp\nIt is possible to store configuration parameters not intended for use by Vamp itself in the Vamp application.conf file, such as configuration for Logstash or workflows. For example, you could chose to include the logstash URL in your custom application.conf file - Vamp would ignore the parameter, but it would be available to all workflows through the API. This is useful for storing shared local configuration parameters. Configuration specific to a single workflow is best set using environment variables or by hard coding the parameter.\n\n Access configuration parameters through the API\nAll configuration parameters can be retrieved from the Vamp API endpoint config or configuration. \n\nReturn all configuration parameters as a JSON object:  \n  GET /api/v1/config .\n  \nReturn a single paramater:  \n  GET /api/v1/config/configuration parameter name  \n\nFor example GET vamp url/api/v1/config/vamp.info.message \n\nOr, from a workflow using Vamp node.JS client (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client):\n\napi.config().each(function (config)  );\n\n  \nCheck the configuration reference\nLook at some example configurations\nFollow the tutorials\nYou can read in depth about using Vamp or browse the API reference or CLI reference docs.\n  \n","id":95},{"path":"/documentation/configure/v0.9.2/example-configurations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Example configurations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"example-configurations-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Configuration\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nreference.conf default settings\nreference.conf is part of the Vamp code and should not be modified. It contains generic defaults for many parameters, but does not constitute a full Vamp configuration. Environment-specific settings need to be added in in application.conf or using environment variables and/or Java system properties.  \n\nThe full reference.conf file can be found in the Vamp project repo (github.com/magneticio - Vamp reference.conf).\n\n application.conf\nYou can use application.conf to tailor the Vamp configuration to fit your environment. Settings specified here, or in environment variables, will override any defaults included in reference.conf. Template configuration files are provided, which complete the standard required settings and include the Vamp Health and Metrics workflows (required by the Vamp UI).

You can override settings in the configuration files using Vamp environment variables or Java/JVM system properties, or update the applied configuration at runtime using a key value store. Vamp configuration is built in layers following this order:\n\nreference.conf - part of the Vamp code. Contains generic, default settings. Not a full configuration.\napplication.conf - adds environment specifics to the generic reference.conf defaults.\nJava system properties - advised for advanced use only.\nEnvironment variables - overrides settings in reference.conf, application.conf and Java system properties.\nKey value store - overrides the applied configuration of Vamp at runtime. Note that http-api configuration cannot be updated in the key value store. If you need to update this, use environment variables.\n\nOn this page:\n\nOverride specific configuration parameters\nUse a custom application.conf file\nParameterize application.conf\nInclude configuration not intended for Vamp\nAccess configuration parameters through the API\n\n Override specific configuration parameters\nYou can override specific parameters set in the application.conf and reference.conf configuration files using Vamp environment variables or Java/JVM system properties. It is advisable to use environment variables when overriding specific parameters.\n\nEnvironment variables\nEnvironment variables override all other settings. Convert the configuration parameter name to upper case and replace all non-alphanumerics with an underscore `.  So, vamp.gateway-driver.timeout becomes VAMPGATEWAYDRIVERTIMEOUT`.  \n\nFor example, to change the vamp.info.message you would set the environment variable VAMPINFOMESSAGE :\n\ndocker run --net=host \\\n           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n           -v docker-machine ssh default \"which docker\":/bin/docker \\\n           -v \"/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup\" \\\n           -e \"DOCKERHOSTIP=$(docker-machine ip default)\" \\\n           -e \"VAMPINFOMESSAGE=hey YOU! \" \\\n           magneticio/vamp-docker:0.9.3\n\n Java system properties\nConfiguration by system properties is advised for advanced use only. Overriding specific settings can be best handled using environment variables. If you require extensive customisation, consider creating a new docker image with a custom application.conf file. For example:\n\nexport VAMPINFOMESSAGE=Hello # overriding Vamp info message (vamp.info.message)\n\njava -Dvamp.gateway-driver.host=localhost \\\n     -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml \\\n     -Dconfig.file=application.conf \\\n     -jar vamp.jar\n\nUse a custom application.conf file\nFor more extensive customisations, you can create a new Docker image, extending one of the provided Vamp images with a custom application.conf file. The below example explains the steps for creating a Docker image with a custom DCOS config, if you are using a different container management platform you should use the associated application.conf and adjust the Docker file accordingly.\n\nCopy application.conf (github.com/magneticio - Vamp DCOS application.conf)\nAdjust as required. Check the list of configuration settings (below) for details of the available optionsa\nCreate a Dockerfile with the lines:  \n  FROM magneticio/vamp-dcos:0.9.3  \n  ADD application.conf /usr/local/vamp/conf/\nBuild the image with docker build --tag username/vamp\n\n Parameterize application.conf\n\nTo avoid duplication of configuration and make it easier to overwrite specific settings you can define global variables outside the vamp   stanza, at the top of application.conf. \n\nFor example:\nvamp_host = \"localhost\"    # Default value\nvamphost = $   # If environment variable exists, use this value\n\nvamp  \n    timeout = 3 seconds\n     \n \n\nThis is as of 0.9.3 how we configure our DC/OS Docker image\n\n(Typesafe documentation on the topic covering system or env variable overrides)[https://github.com/typesafehub/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides]\n\nInclude configuration not intended for Vamp\nIt is possible to store configuration parameters not intended for use by Vamp itself in the Vamp application.conf file, such as configuration for workflows. Vamp would ignore the parameter, but it would be available to all workflows through the API. This is useful for storing shared local configuration parameters. Configuration specific to a single workflow is best set using environment variables or by hard coding the parameter.\n\n Access configuration parameters through the API\nAll configuration parameters can be retrieved from the Vamp API endpoint config or configuration. \n\nReturn all configuration parameters as a JSON object:  \n  GET /api/v1/config .\n  \nReturn a single paramater:  \n  GET /api/v1/config/configuration parameter name  \n\nFor example GET vamp url/api/v1/config/vamp.info.message \n\nOr, from a workflow using Vamp node.JS client (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client):\n\napi.config().each(function (config)  );\n\n  \nCheck the configuration reference\nLook at some example configurations\nFollow the tutorials\nYou can read in depth about using Vamp or browse the API reference or CLI reference docs.\n  \n","id":98},{"path":"/documentation/configure/v0.9.3/example-configurations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Example configurations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"example-configurations-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Configuration\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nreference.conf default settings\nreference.conf files are part of the Vamp code and should not be modified.

For example:\n\nexport VAMPINFOMESSAGE=Hello  overriding Vamp info message (vamp.info.message)\n\njava -Dvamp.gateway-driver.host=localhost \\\n     -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml \\\n     -Dconfig.file=application.conf \\\n     -jar vamp.jar\n\nUse a custom application.conf file\nFor more extensive customisations, you can create a new Docker image, extending one of the provided Vamp images with a custom application.conf file. The below example explains the steps for creating a Docker image with a custom DCOS config, if you are using a different container management platform you should use the associated application.conf and adjust the Docker file accordingly.\n\nCopy application.conf (github.com/magneticio - Vamp DCOS application.conf)\nAdjust as required. Check the list of configuration settings (below) for details of the available optionsa\nCreate a Dockerfile with the lines:  \n  FROM magneticio/vamp-dcos:0.9.4  \n  ADD application.conf /usr/local/vamp/conf/\nBuild the image with docker build --tag username/vamp\n\n Parameterize application.conf\n\nTo avoid duplication of configuration and make it easier to overwrite specific settings you can define global variables outside the vamp   stanza, at the top of application.conf. \n\nFor example:\nvamp_host = \"localhost\"    # Default value\nvamphost = $   # If environment variable exists, use this value\n\nvamp  \n    timeout = 3 seconds\n     \n \n\nThis is as of 0.9.4 how we configure our DC/OS Docker image\n\n(Typesafe documentation on the topic covering system or env variable overrides)[https://github.com/typesafehub/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides]\n\nInclude configuration not intended for Vamp\nIt is possible to store configuration parameters not intended for use by Vamp itself in the Vamp application.conf file, such as configuration for workflows.

There is no set architecture required for running Vamp and every use case or specific combination of tools and platforms can have its own set up.\n\n Example topology\nThe below diagram should be used more as an overview than required architecture. For example, in this diagram the Mesos/Marathon stack and Elasticsearch are included even though these are not a hard dependency. Vamp can be configured to run with other container schedulers, log-aggregators, key-value and event-stores.\n\nVamp components\n\nVamp consists of server- and client-side components that work together with elements in your architecture to handle orchetstration, routing, persistence and metrics aggregation.\n\n Vamp UI  \nThe Vamp UI is a graphical web interface for managing Vamp in a web browser. It is packaged with Vamp.\n\nVamp CLI  \nThe Vamp CLI is a command line interface for managing Vamp and providing integration with (shell) scripts. It's currently not very well maintained but still can be useful if our REST API cannot be used for your integration requirements.\n\n Vamp  \nVamp is the main API endpoint, business logic and service coordinator. Vamp talks to the configured container manager (Docker, Marathon, Kubernetes etc.) and synchronizes it with Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul (distributed key-value stores). Vamp can use Elasticsearch for artifact persistence and to store events (e.g. changes in deployments). Typically, there should be one Vamp instance and one or more VGA instances. Vamp is not a realtime application and only updates deployments and routing when asked to (reactive) and thus doesn't need to run with multiple instances in HA mode. If this is a hard requirement of your project please contact us for the Vamp Enterprise Edition.\n\nVamp workflows\nVamp workflows are small applications or scripts (for example using JavaScript or your own containers) that automate changes of the running system, and its deployments and gateways. We have included a set of useful workflows out of the box, such as health and metrics, which are used by the Vamp UI to report system status and to enable autoscaling and self-healing. Our Vamp Runner project provides more advanced workflow recipes as an example.\n\n Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  \nVamp Gateway Agent (VGA) reads the HAProxy configuration from ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul and reloads HAProxy on each configuration change with as close to zero client request interruptions as possible. Typically, there should be one Vamp instance and one or more VGA instances.     \nLogs from HAProxy are read over socket and pushed to Logstash over UDP.  VGA will handle and recover from ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul and Logstash outages without interrupting the HAProxy process and client requests.  \n\n  \nRead about the requirements to run Vamp\n  \n","id":106},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.2/events-and-metrics","date":"2016-10-21T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events and metrics","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"events-and-metrics-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nTo provide an effective feedback loop, HTTP/TCP logs should be collected, stored and analyzed. Collection and storing is done with a combination of HAProxy, VGA and Logstash setup. Logs are stored in Elasticsearch and can be later visualised by Kibana.\n\nHow traffic is logged\n\nVamp uses Logstash to format and store logs from running applications HAProxy (via Vamp Gateway Agent) in Elasticsearch indices. Logstash listens on UDP port and formats incoming log raw data in json format. Vamp API actions (including those generated by Vamp workflows and the Vamp UI) and running service events are stored by the Vamp API to specific Elasticsearch indices. \nData and events are read by Vamp components either directly from Elasticsearch or via the Vamp API:\n\nThe Vamp UI reads data and events via the Vamp API. Health and Metrics events (generated by Vamp workflows) are required by the Vamp UI.\nVamp workflows read formatted log data directly from Elasticsearch and events are via the Vamp API. In theory, workflows could also read events directly from Elasticsearch.\n\n Formatted raw data (logs)\n\nHAProxy\nHAProxy generates logs and makes them accessible via open socket - check the HAProxy configuration of log (github.com/magneticio - haproxy.cfg).\nVGA listens on log socket and any new messages are forwarded to the Logstash instance. The HAProxy log format is configurable in Vamp configuration vamp.gateway-driver.haproxy (github.com/magneticio - reference.conf).\nIn general, for each HTTP/TCP request to HAProxy, several log messages are created (e.g. for gateway, service and instance level). \n\n Logstash\n\nA simple Logstash configuration should be sufficient for dozens of requests per second - or even more, depending on whether Elastic Stack (ELK) is also used for custom application/service logs etc. This example Logstash configuration (github.com/magneticio - logstash.conf), together with the default vamp.gateway-driver.haproxy log format, will transform logs to plain JSON, which can be parsed easily later on (e.g. for Kibana visualisation).  \nFor alternative Logstash/Elasticsearch setups you can check these examples (elastic.co - Deploying and Scaling Logstash) and the Logstash command line parameter (github.com/magneticio - Logstash section).\n\n  \nLogstash listens on UDP port, but in principle any other listener can receive logs forwarded by VGA.\nDifferent VGAs can use different Logstash instances.\n  \n\nEvents\n\nVamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions.\nAll events are stored and retrieved using the Event API, part of the Vamp API.\n\n Kibana\n\n  Vamp can be configured to create Kibana searches, visualisations and dashboards automatically with the vamp.gateway-driver.kibana.enabled configuration parameter.\n  Vamp will do this by inserting ES documents to the Kibana index, so only the URL to access ES is needed (by default reusing the same as for persistence).

To achieve this, Vamp requires access to a container scheduler, key value store, Elastic Search and HAProxy.\n\nContainer scheduler  (orchestration)\nVamp talks directly to your choice of container scheduler. Currently we support Mesos/Marathon, DC/OS, Kubernetes and Rancher. In case you’re “greenfield” and don’t have anything selected or running yet, check which container scheduler?\n\n Key value store\nVamp depends on a key-value (KV) store for non-direct communication between Vamp and instances of the Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA). There is no direct connection between Vamp and the VGA instances, all communication is done by managing specific KV in the store.  When Vamp needs to update the HAProxy configuration (e.g. when a new service has been deployed) Vamp will generate the new configuration and store it in the KV store. The VGAs read specific valuea and reload HAProxy instances accordingly.\nCurrently we support:\n\nZooKeeper (apache.org - zookeeper).  \nVamp and VGAs can use an existing DC/OS ZooKeeper cluster.\netcd (coreos.com - etcd)  \nVamp and VGAs can use an existing Kubernetes etcd cluster.\nConsul (consul.io)\n\nElastic Search (persistence and metrics)\nVamp uses Elastic Search (ES) for persistence (e.g. for artifacts and events) and for aggregating the metrics used by Vamp workflows and the Vamp UI. As Vamp is not demanding in ES resources, it can comfortably work with an existing ES cluster.  \nCurrently we use Logstash to format and send data to Elastic Search, but you could also opt for an alternative solution.\n\n HAProxy  (routing)\nEach Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) requires its own instance of HAProxy. This is a hard requirement, so to keep things simple we provide a Docker container with both Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) and HAProxy (hub.docker.com - magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent).  \n\n  \nFind out how to install Vamp\nHigh level pointers for choosing a container scheduler\n  \n\n","id":108},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.2/routing-and-load-balancing","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Routing and load balancing","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"routing-and-load-balancing-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses the tried and tested HAProxy reverse proxy software for routing/proxying and load balancing (haproxy.com). Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) manages the HAProxy configuration and HAProxy routes incoming traffic to endpoints (explicitly defined external gateways) or handles intra-service routing. By applying some iptables magic, Vamp makes sure that HAProxy configuration updates won't introduce dropped packages., that means zero-downtime reloads.  \n\nRouting\n\nSo how does Vamp exactly route traffic to the designated destinations? First we look for the conditions that might have been set for a route or gateway. This can be none, one or more conditions (see boolean expression in conditions). There are built-in short codes for common conditions, or you can use HAProxy ACLs directly.\n\nIf the condition is met, we evaluate the condition strength percentage. A 100% setting means everybody that meets the condition is sent to this route. A 5% setting means 5% of all visitors that meet the condition are sent to this route, the remaining 95% are returned into the \"bucket\" and distributed using the general weight settings. A weight setting for each available route defines the distribution of all remaining traffic not matching a condition or not targetted by condition strength.\n\n Load balancing\n\nVamp load balancing is done transparently. Based on the scale setting of the running services, Vamp will make sure all instances are load balanced automatically. By default we use a round-robin algorithm, but other HAProxy balancing mechanisms are also supported. We also support sticky routing. The cool thing is that weight and condition percentage settings are applied independently from the number of instances running. I.e. a 50 / 50 weight distribution over two service versions that run with a scale of four and eight instances respectively will still be distributed 50% / 50%. Changing the number of instances will have no effect on the distribution, as Vamp tries to achieve the configured weight and condition strength distributions as closely as possible.\n\nTopology and performance\n\nHAProxy can run as a container or as a standalone service. A Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) Docker image (including HAProxy with specific logstash configuration to provide proxy logs to logstash for the Vamp UI) can be pulled from the Docker hub (hub.docker.com - magneticio Vamp Gateway Agent).\n\nHAProxy can run inside your cluster or on separate machines outside of your container cluster:\n\nHAProxy on one node of a cluster - not advised for production setups as it introduces a single point of failure\nHAProxy on multiple nodes of a cluster - for example, three instances for failover and high-availability \nHAProxy on all nodes of a cluster - the so-called SmartStack pattern (nerds.airbnb.com - smartstack service discovery cloud) \nHAProxy on separate machines outside of your container cluster - Vamp can connect to these instances and can add its routing rules to your custom HAProxy configuration templates if needed.\n\nPerformance-wise, HAProxy is very efficient and uses few resources. In our experiments we have seen a sub-millisecond overhead. Even with very complex and combined routing rules, the total overhead stays in the microseconds range. This means a single HAProxy running on a small VM (for example, an AWS micro instance) would process enough network traffic that you would notice a bottleneck from your network and applications first.\n\nVamp is not a realtime system. As long as at least one HAProxy and one container-node are running your visitors will be able to reach the container - even with no Vamp or VGA running. On restart, Vamp and VGA will automatically sync and update themselves. \n\n  \nRead about how Vamp works with events and metrics\nFind out more about using Vamp conditions and gateways\n  \n","id":109},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.2/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"hvw-service-discovery-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery).

In case you’re “greenfield” and don’t have anything selected or running yet, here are some high-level pointers to help you make an informed decision: \n\nWorking with big data - Mesos/Marathon, DC/OS, Azure Container Service\nRunning web-based applications - Kubernetes, Google Container Engine\nManaging (virtual) infrastructure - Rancher with Docker or Kubernetes\nJust running Docker\n\nWhichever option you choose now, Vamp is container systems agnostic, so all your blueprints and workflows will keep on working if you decide to switch in the future *.\n\n----,\nWorking with big data \nIf you are working with typical big data solutions like Kafka, Cassandra or Spark (often combined in something called SMACK stack), and/or want to run not only containers on your cluster it makes sense to investigate Mesos/Marathon first. A lot of big data frameworks can run as native Mesos frameworks and you can combine the underlying infrastructure to share resources between these frameworks running on Mesos and your containers running inside Marathon (which is a Mesos framework in itself).\n\n Add in commercial support\nIf you have the same requirements as described above, but you're more comfortable buying commercial support, moving towards DC/OS makes sense. DC/OS is based on Mesos/Marathon, but adds additional features and a fancy UI. You can purchase commercial DC/OS support or buy an enterprise version from Mesosphere (the company that initiated Mesos and Marathon).\n\nHosted solution\nIf you're looking for a hosted version of DC/OS you could investigate Azure Container Service which let's you choose between DC/OS or Docker Swarm.\n\n----,\n Running web-based applications  \nIf you're solely interested in running (micro)services, APIs and other web-based applications, Kubernetes is an integrated cluster-manager and -scheduler, and is specifically designed for running containers with web-focused payloads. \n\nAdd in commercial support\nAt this point, commercial support and fancy dashboards are less easy to find for Kubernetes. However, Kubernetes is the scheduler used in Redhat software (Openshift V3), so if your company used Redhat software this might make sense to investigate.\n\n hosted solution\nA hosted version of Kubernetes is available from Google (Google Container Engine). \n\n----,\nManaging (virtual) infrastructure\nIf you want to manage and provision (virtual) infrastructure as well as manage and run containers, Rancher is a viable option. Rancher provides a Docker or Kubernetes based container scheduler and adds infrastructure provisioning with a nice graphical UI.\n\n----,\n Just running Docker\nIf you want to stay within the Docker ecosystem, Vamp works nicely with (single machine) Docker.

There is no set architecture required for running Vamp and every use case or specific combination of tools and platforms can have its own set up.\n\n Example topology\nThe below diagram should be used more as an overview than required architecture. For example, in this diagram the Mesos/Marathon stack and Elasticsearch are included even though these are not a hard dependency. Vamp can be configured to run with other container schedulers, log-aggregators, key-value and event-stores.\n\nVamp components\n\nVamp consists of server- and client-side components that work together with elements in your architecture to handle orchetstration, routing, persistence and metrics aggregation.\n\n Vamp UI  \nThe Vamp UI is a graphical web interface for managing Vamp in a web browser. It is packaged with Vamp.\n\nVamp CLI  \nThe Vamp CLI is a command line interface for managing Vamp and providing integration with (shell) scripts. It's currently not very well maintained but still can be useful if our REST API cannot be used for your integration requirements.\n\n Vamp  \nVamp is the main API endpoint, business logic and service coordinator. Vamp talks to the configured container manager (Docker, Marathon, Kubernetes etc.) and synchronizes it with Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul (distributed key-value stores). Vamp can use Elasticsearch for artifact persistence and to store events (e.g. changes in deployments). Typically, there should be one Vamp instance and one or more VGA instances. Vamp is not a realtime application and only updates deployments and routing when asked to (reactive) and thus doesn't need to run with multiple instances in HA mode. If this is a hard requirement of your project please contact us for the Vamp Enterprise Edition.\n\nVamp workflows\nVamp workflows are small applications or scripts (for example using JavaScript or your own containers) that automate changes of the running system, and its deployments and gateways. We have included a set of useful workflows out of the box, such as health and metrics, which are used by the Vamp UI to report system status and to enable autoscaling and self-healing. Our Vamp Runner project provides more advanced workflow recipes as an example.\n\n Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  \nVamp Gateway Agent (VGA) uses confd to read the HAProxy configuration from ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul and reloads HAProxy on each configuration change with as close to zero client request interruptions as possible.

Logs are stored with a unique ID and can be later visualised by Kibana. Vamp API actions (including those generated by Vamp workflows and the Vamp UI) and running service events are stored in Elasticsearch indices according to event type. \nData and events are read by Vamp components either directly from Elasticsearch or via the Vamp API:\n\nThe Vamp UI reads data and events via the Vamp API.

Currently we support Mesos/Marathon, DC/OS, Kubernetes and Rancher. In case you’re “greenfield” and don’t have anything selected or running yet, check which container scheduler?\n\n Key value store\nVamp depends on a key-value (KV) store for non-direct communication between Vamp and instances of the Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA). There is no direct connection between Vamp and the VGA instances, all communication is done by managing specific KV in the store.  When Vamp needs to update the HAProxy configuration (e.g. when a new service has been deployed) Vamp will generate the new configuration and store it in the KV store. The VGAs read specific valuea and reload HAProxy instances accordingly.\nCurrently we support:\n\nZooKeeper (apache.org - zookeeper).  \nVamp and VGAs can use an existing DC/OS ZooKeeper cluster.\netcd (coreos.com - etcd)  \nVamp and VGAs can use an existing Kubernetes etcd cluster.\nConsul (consul.io)\n\nElastic Search (persistence and metrics)\nVamp uses Elastic Search (ES) for persistence (e.g. for artifacts and events) and for aggregating the metrics used by Vamp workflows and the Vamp UI. As Vamp is not demanding in ES resources, it can comfortably work with an existing ES cluster.  \nCurrently we use Filebeat to send  HAproxy logs to Elastic Search, but you could also opt for an alternative solution.\n\n HAProxy  (routing)\nEach Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) requires its own instance of HAProxy. This is a hard requirement, so to keep things simple we provide a Docker container with both Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) and HAProxy (hub.docker.com - magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent).  \n\n  \nFind out how to install Vamp\nHigh level pointers for choosing a container scheduler\n  \n\n","id":120},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.4/routing-and-load-balancing","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Routing and load balancing","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"routing-and-load-balancing-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses the tried and tested HAProxy reverse proxy software for routing/proxying and load balancing (haproxy.com). Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) manages the HAProxy configuration and HAProxy routes incoming traffic to endpoints (explicitly defined external gateways) or handles intra-service routing. By applying some iptables magic, Vamp makes sure that HAProxy configuration updates won't introduce dropped packages., that means zero-downtime reloads.  \n\nRouting\n\nSo how does Vamp exactly route traffic to the designated destinations? First we look for the conditions that might have been set for a route or gateway. This can be none, one or more conditions (see boolean expression in conditions). There are built-in short codes for common conditions, or you can use HAProxy ACLs directly.\n\nIf the condition is met, we evaluate the condition strength percentage. A 100% setting means everybody that meets the condition is sent to this route. A 5% setting means 5% of all visitors that meet the condition are sent to this route, the remaining 95% are returned into the \"bucket\" and distributed using the general weight settings. A weight setting for each available route defines the distribution of all remaining traffic not matching a condition or not targetted by condition strength.\n\n Load balancing\n\nVamp load balancing is done transparently. Based on the scale setting of the running services, Vamp will make sure all instances are load balanced automatically. By default we use a round-robin algorithm, but other HAProxy balancing mechanisms are also supported. We also support sticky routing. The cool thing is that weight and condition percentage settings are applied independently from the number of instances running. I.e. a 50 / 50 weight distribution over two service versions that run with a scale of four and eight instances respectively will still be distributed 50% / 50%. Changing the number of instances will have no effect on the distribution, as Vamp tries to achieve the configured weight and condition strength distributions as closely as possible.\n\nTopology and performance\n\nHAProxy can run as a container or as a standalone service. A Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) Docker image can be pulled from the Docker hub (hub.docker.com - magneticio Vamp Gateway Agent).\n\nHAProxy can run inside your cluster or on separate machines outside of your container cluster:\n\nHAProxy on one node of a cluster - not advised for production setups as it introduces a single point of failure\nHAProxy on multiple nodes of a cluster - for example, three instances for failover and high-availability \nHAProxy on all nodes of a cluster - the so-called SmartStack pattern (nerds.airbnb.com - smartstack service discovery cloud) \nHAProxy on separate machines outside of your container cluster - Vamp can connect to these instances and can add its routing rules to your custom HAProxy configuration templates if needed.\n\nPerformance-wise, HAProxy is very efficient and uses few resources. In our experiments we have seen a sub-millisecond overhead. Even with very complex and combined routing rules, the total overhead stays in the microseconds range. This means a single HAProxy running on a small VM (for example, an AWS micro instance) would process enough network traffic that you would notice a bottleneck from your network and applications first.\n\nVamp is not a realtime system. As long as at least one HAProxy and one container-node are running your visitors will be able to reach the container - even with no Vamp or VGA running. On restart, Vamp and VGA will automatically sync and update themselves. \n\n  \nRead about how Vamp works with events and metrics\nFind out more about using Vamp conditions and gateways\n  \n","id":121},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.4/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"hvw-service-discovery-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery).

A 5% setting means 5% of all visitors that meet the condition are sent to this route, the remaining 95% are returned into the \"bucket\" and distributed using the general weight settings. A weight setting for each available route defines the distribution of all remaining traffic not matching a condition or not targetted by condition strength.\n\n Load balancing\n\nVamp load balancing is done transparently. Based on the scale setting of the running services, Vamp will make sure all instances are load balanced automatically. By default we use a round-robin algorithm, but other HAProxy balancing mechanisms are also supported. We also support sticky routing. The cool thing is that weight and condition percentage settings are applied independently from the number of instances running. I.e. a 50 / 50 weight distribution over two service versions that run with a scale of four and eight instances respectively will still be distributed 50% / 50%. Changing the number of instances will have no effect on the distribution, as Vamp tries to achieve the configured weight and condition strength distributions as closely as possible.\n\nTopology and performance\n\nHAProxy can run as a container or as a standalone service. A Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) Docker image can be pulled from the Docker hub (hub.docker.com - magneticio Vamp Gateway Agent).\n\nHAProxy can run inside your cluster or on separate machines outside of your container cluster:\n\nHAProxy on one node of a cluster - not advised for production setups as it introduces a single point of failure\nHAProxy on multiple nodes of a cluster - for example, three instances for failover and high-availability \nHAProxy on all nodes of a cluster - the so-called SmartStack pattern (nerds.airbnb.com - smartstack service discovery cloud) \nHAProxy on separate machines outside of your container cluster - Vamp can connect to these instances and can add its routing rules to your custom HAProxy configuration templates if needed.\n\nPerformance-wise, HAProxy is very efficient and uses few resources. In our experiments we have seen a sub-millisecond overhead. Even with very complex and combined routing rules, the total overhead stays in the microseconds range. This means a single HAProxy running on a small VM (for example, an AWS micro instance) would process enough network traffic that you would notice a bottleneck from your network and applications first.\n\nVamp is not a realtime system. As long as at least one HAProxy and one container-node are running your visitors will be able to reach the container - even with no Vamp or VGA running. On restart, Vamp and VGA will automatically sync and update themselves. \n\n  \nRead about how Vamp works with events and metrics\nFind out more about using Vamp conditions and gateways\n  \n","id":127},{"path":"/documentation/how vamp works/v0.9.5/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","aliases":"","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"hvw-service-discovery-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"How Vamp works\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\nVamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery).

In case you’re “greenfield” and don’t have anything selected or running yet, here are some high-level pointers to help you make an informed decision: \n\nWorking with big data - Mesos/Marathon, DC/OS, Azure Container Service\nRunning web-based applications - Kubernetes, Google Container Engine\nManaging (virtual) infrastructure - Rancher with Docker or Kubernetes\nJust running Docker\n\nWhichever option you choose now, Vamp is container systems agnostic, so all your blueprints and workflows will keep on working if you decide to switch in the future *.\n\n----,\nWorking with big data \nIf you are working with typical big data solutions like Kafka, Cassandra or Spark (often combined in something called SMACK stack), and/or want to run not only containers on your cluster it makes sense to investigate Mesos/Marathon first. A lot of big data frameworks can run as native Mesos frameworks and you can combine the underlying infrastructure to share resources between these frameworks running on Mesos and your containers running inside Marathon (which is a Mesos framework in itself).\n\n Add in commercial support\nIf you have the same requirements as described above, but you're more comfortable buying commercial support, moving towards DC/OS makes sense. DC/OS is based on Mesos/Marathon, but adds additional features and a fancy UI. You can purchase commercial DC/OS support or buy an enterprise version from Mesosphere (the company that initiated Mesos and Marathon).\n\nHosted solution\nIf you're looking for a hosted version of DC/OS you could investigate Azure Container Service which let's you choose between DC/OS or Docker Swarm.\n\n----,\n Running web-based applications  \nIf you're solely interested in running (micro)services, APIs and other web-based applications, Kubernetes is an integrated cluster-manager and -scheduler, and is specifically designed for running containers with web-focused payloads. \n\nAdd in commercial support\nAt this point, commercial support and fancy dashboards are less easy to find for Kubernetes. However, Kubernetes is the scheduler used in Redhat software (Openshift V3), so if your company used Redhat software this might make sense to investigate.\n\n hosted solution\nA hosted version of Kubernetes is available from Google (Google Container Engine). \n\n----,\nManaging (virtual) infrastructure\nIf you want to manage and provision (virtual) infrastructure as well as manage and run containers, Rancher is a viable option. Rancher provides a Docker or Kubernetes based container scheduler and adds infrastructure provisioning with a nice graphical UI.\n\n----,\n Just running Docker\nIf you want to stay within the Docker ecosystem, Vamp works nicely with (single machine) Docker.

On this page we start out with the most common setup, but if you are interested in doing a custom install or working with public and private nodes you should jump to that section.\n\nStandard install\nCustom install\nPublic and private nodes\n\nStandard install\nThis setup will run Vamp, Mesos and Marathon, together with Zookeeper, Elasticsearch and Logstash on DC/OS. \n\n Tested against\nThis guide has been tested on both 1.7 and the latest 1.8 version of DC/OS.\n\nRequirements\nBefore you start you need to have a DC/OS cluster up and running, as well as the its CLI configured to use it. We assume you have it up and running on http://dcos.example.com/.\nSetting up DC/OS is outside the scope of this document, for that you need to refer to the official documentation:\n\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.7/usage/cli/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/usage/cli/\n\n Step 1: Install Elasticsearch + Logstash\n\nMesos, Marathon and ZooKeeper are all installed by DC/OS. In addition to these, Vamp requires Elasticsearch and Logstash for metrics collection and aggregation.\n\nYou could install Elasticsearch on DC/OS by following the Mesos Elasticsearch documentation (mesos-elasticsearch - Elasticsearch Mesos Framework).\nHowever, Vamp will also need Logstash (not currently available as a DC/OS package) with a specific Vamp Logstash configuration (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Docker logstash.conf).  \n\nTo make life easier, we have created compatible Docker images for a Vamp Elastic Stack (hub.docker.com - magneticio elastic) that you can use with the Mesos elasticsearch documentation (mesos-elasticsearch - How to install on Marathon).\nOur advice is to use our custom Elasticsearch+Logstash Docker image. Let's get started!\n\nCreate elasticsearch.json with the following content:\n\n \n   ,\n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis will run the container with 1G of RAM and a basic health check on the elasticsearch port.\n\nUsing the CLI we can install this in our cluster:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add elasticsearch.json\n\nIf you get no error message you should now be able to see it being deployed:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nOnce it's fully up and running you should see all tasks and health checks being up:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n\nStep 2: Deploy Vamp\n\nOnce you have elasticsearch up and running it's time to move on to Vamp. The Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nCreate vamp.json with the following content:\n\n \n         \n      ],\n      \"forcePullImage\": true\n     \n   ,\n  \"labels\":  ,\n  \"env\":  ,  \n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis service definition will download our Vamp container and spin it up in your DC/OS cluster on a private node in bridge networking mode. It will also configure the apporiate labels for the AdminRouter to expose the UI through DC/OS, as well as an internal VIP for other applications to talk to Vamp, adjusting some defaults to work inside DC/OS, and finally a health check for monitoring.\n\nDeploy it with the CLI, like with did with elasticsearch:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add vamp.json\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n/vamp/vamp      1024  0.5    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nIt will take a minute for Vamp to deploy all its components, you can see that by looking in the \"tasks\" column, where Vamp is listed as 0/1. Run the list command again and you should see all the components coming online:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID                        MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD\n/elasticsearch            1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp                1024  0.5    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp-gateway-agent  256   0.2    3/3    ---       ---        DOCKER   ['--storeType=zookeeper', '--storeConnection=zk-1.zk:2181', '--storeKey=/vamp/gateways/haproxy/1.6', '--logstash=elasticsearch.marathon.mesos:10001']\n/vamp/workflow-health      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-kibana      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-metrics     64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-vga         64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n\nVamp has now spun up all it's components and you should be able to access the ui by opening http://dcos.example.com/service/vamp/ in your browser.\n\nNow you're ready to follow our Vamp getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

You might want to add a HTTPS proxy in front of Vamp with at least basic authentication.\n\nTo remove the quickstart deployment, use the following command:\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.2/vampkubeuninstall.sh \\\n  | bash\n\nManual deployment\n\n Deploy etcd, Elasticsearch and Logstash\n\nNow let's deploy etcd - this installation is based on the tutorial (github.com/coreos - etcd on Kubernetes).  Note that this is not a production grade setup - you would also need to take care of persistence and running multiple replicas of each pod.\nFirst, execute:\n\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.2/etcd.yml\n\nThen deploy Elasticsearch and Logstash with a proper Vamp Logstash configuration (github.com/magneticio - elastic) using:\n\nkubectl run elastic --image=magneticio/elastic:2.2\nkubectl expose deployment elastic --protocol=TCP --port=9200 --name=elasticsearch\nkubectl expose deployment elastic --protocol=UDP --port=10001 --name=logstash\nkubectl expose deployment elastic --protocol=TCP --port=5601 --name=kibana\n\nRun Vamp\n\nNow we can run Vamp gateway agent as a daemon set:\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.2/vga.yml\n\nTo deploy Vamp, execute:\n\nkubectl run vamp --image=magneticio/vamp:0.9.2-kubernetes\nkubectl expose deployment vamp --protocol=TCP --port=8080 --name=vamp --type=\"LoadBalancer\"\n\nAs a reference, you can find the latest Vamp katana  Kubernetes configuration here: github.com/magneticio - Vamp Kubernetes configuration.

Once it's running we can check if all Vamp Gateway Agent services are up:\n\nkubectl get services --show-labels -l vamp=gateway\n\nWe can see that for each gateway a new service is created:\n\nNAME                      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE       LABELS\nhex1f8c9a0157c9fe3335e9   10.3.243.199   104.155.24.47   9050/TCP    2m        lookup_name=a7ad6869e65e9c047f956cf7d1b4d01a89e\nef486,vamp=gateway\nhex26bb0695e9a85ec34b03   10.3.245.85    23.251.143.62   40000/TCP   2m        lookup_name=6ace45cb2c155e85bd0c84123d1dab5a6cb\n12c97,vamp=gateway\n\n  \nIn this setup Vamp is deliberately configured to initiate exposure of all gateway and VGA ports. This would not be the case if the default and recommended setting are used.\n  \n\nNow we can access our sava service on http://104.155.24.47:9050\n\nIn the Kubernetes dashboard you will see the external endpoint appear with a hyperlink icon behind it in the \"Services\" overview when the external gateway of your deployment is available. You can recognise it by the port that's included in the endpoint that you have defined in your blueprint gateway definition.\n\nThe default Kubernetes service type can be set in configuration: vamp.container-driver.kubernetes.service-type, possible values are LoadBalancer or NodePort. We can also access gateways using virtual hosts. Vamp Gateway Agent service is on IP 146.148.22.145 in this example, so:\ncurl --resolve 9050.sava-1-0.vamp:80:146.148.22.145 -v http://9050.sava-1-0.vamp\n\nDon't forget to clean up your Kubernetes cluster and firewall rules  if you don't want to use them anymore (google.com - container engine quickstart: clean up).\n\n  \n\nOnce you have Vamp up and running you can jump into the getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

(We'll also deploy our demo Sava application to give you something to play around on). Before you begin, it is advisable to try out the official Rancher Quick Start Guide tutorial first (rancher.com - quick start guide).\n\n  \nRancher support is still in Alpha.\n  \n\nTested against\nThis guide has been tested on Rancher version 1.1.x.\n\n Requirements\n\nRancher up and running\nKey-value store like ZooKeeper, Consul or etcd\nElasticsearch and Logstash\nIf you want to make a setup on your local VM based Docker, it's advisable to increase default VM memory size from 1GB to 4GB.\n\nRun Rancher locally\nBased on the official Rancher quickstart tutorial, these are a few simple steps to run Rancher locally:\n$ docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 rancher/server\nThe Rancher UI is exposed on port 8080, so go to http://SERVER_IP:8080 - for instance http://192.168.99.100:8080, http://localhost:8080 or something similar depending on your Docker setup.\n\nFollow the instructions on the screen to add a new Rancher host. Click on \"Add Host\" and then on \"Save\". You should get instructions (bullet point 5) to run an agent Docker image:  \n\n$ docker run \\\n  -d --privileged \\\n  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  -v /var/lib/rancher:/var/lib/rancher \\\n  rancher/agent:v1.0.1 \\\n  http://192.168.99.100:8080/v1/scripts/E78EF5848B989FD4DA77:1466265600000:SYqIvhPgzKLonp8r0erqgpsi7pQ\n\n Create a Vamp stack\nNext we need to create a Vamp stack and add all dependencies (Consul, Elasticsearch, Logstash). Our custom Docker image magneticio/elastic:2.2 contains Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana with the proper Logstash configuration for Vamp. More details can be found on the github project page (github.com/magneticio - elastic).\n\nGo to Add Stack and create a new stack vamp (lowercase).\nInstall Consul:  \n  Use the vamp stack and go to Add Service:  \n    Name ⇒ consul\n    Select Image ⇒ gliderlabs/consul-server\n    Set Command ⇒ -server -bootstrap\n    Go to the Networking tab\n    Under Hostname select Set a specific hostname: and enter consul\n    Click the Create button\n\nInstall Elasticsearch and Logstash:\n  Use the vamp stack and go to Add Service:  \n    Name ⇒ elastic\n    Select Image ⇒ magneticio/elastic:2.2\n    Go to the Networking tab\n    Under Hostname select Set a specific hostname: and enter elastic\n    Click Create\n\nRun Vamp\n\nFirst we'll run the Vamp Gateway Agent:\n\nUse the vamp stack and go to Add Service:\nSet scale to Always run one instance of this container on every host\nName ⇒ vamp-gateway-agent\nSelect Image ⇒ magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent:0.9.2\nSet Command ⇒ --storeType=consul --storeConnection=consul:8500 --storeKey=/vamp/gateways/haproxy/1.6 --logstash=elastic:10001\nGo to Networking tab\nUnder Hostname select Set a specific hostname: and enter vamp-gateway-agent\nClick Create \n\nNow let's find a Rancher API endpoint that can be accessed from running container:\n\nGo to the API page and find the endpoint, e.g. http://192.168.99.100:8080/v1/projects/1a5\nGo to the Infrastructure/Containers and find the IP address of rancher/server, e.g. 172.17.0.2\nThe Rancher API endpoint should be then http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/PATH based on values we have, e.g. http://172.17.0.2:8080/v1/projects/1a5\n\nNow we can deploy Vamp:\n\nUse the vamp stack and go to Add Service:\nName ⇒ vamp\nSelect Image ⇒ magneticio/vamp:0.9.2-rancher\nGo to Add environment variable VAMPCONTAINERDRIVERRANCHERURL with value of Rancher API endpoint, e.g. http://172.17.0.2:8080/v1/projects/1a5\n(optional) add a VAMPCONTAINERDRIVERRANCHERUSER variable with a Rancher API access key if your Rancher installation has access control enabled\n(optional) add a VAMPCONTAINERDRIVERRANCHERPASSWORD variable with a matching Rancher API secret key.\nGo to Networking tab\nUnder Hostname select Set a specific hostname: and enter vamp\nClick Create\nGo to Add Load Balancer (click arrow next to Add Service button label)\nChoose a name (e.g. vamp-lb)\nSource IP/Port ⇒ 9090\nDefault Target Port ⇒ 8080 and Target Service ⇒ vamp\n\nIf you go to http://SERVER_IP:9090 (e.g http://192.168.99.100:9090), you should get the Vamp UI.  You should also notice that Vamp Gateway Agent is running (one instance on each node) and you can see some Vamp workflows running.\nThe Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.  \n\nTo access HAProxy stats, go to Add Load Balancer (click the arrow next to Add Service). Choose a name (e.g. vamp-gateway-agent-lb) and set:\n \nSource IP/Port ⇒ 1988\nDefault Target Port ⇒ 1988 \nTarget Service ⇒ vamp-gateway-agent\n\nYou can access the HAProxy stats page with username/password haproxy.\n\n Deploy the Sava demo application\n\nLet's deploy our sava demo application:\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2\n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\nIf you want the gateway port to be exposed outside of the cluster via a Rancher Load Balancer:\n\nGo to Add Load Balancer (click arrow next to Add Service)\nChoose name (e.g. gateway-9050),\n  Source IP/Port ⇒ 9050\n  Default Target Port ⇒ 9050\n  Target Service ⇒ vamp-gateway-agent\n\n  \n\nOnce you have Vamp up and running you can jump into the getting started tutorials\nThings still not running?

We assume you have it up and running on http://dcos.example.com/.\nSetting up DC/OS is outside the scope of this document, for that you need to refer to the official documentation:\n\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.7/usage/cli/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/usage/cli/\n\n Step 1: Install Elasticsearch\n\nMesos, Marathon and ZooKeeper are all installed by DC/OS. In addition to these, Vamp requires Elasticsearch for metrics collection and aggregation. You can use the magneticio Docker images to deploy a compatible Vamp Elastic Stack (hub.docker.com - magneticio elastic)\n\nCreate elasticsearch.json with the following content:\n\n \n   ,\n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis will run the container with 1G of RAM and a basic health check on the elasticsearch port.\n\nUsing the CLI we can install this in our cluster:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add elasticsearch.json\n\nIf you get no error message you should now be able to see it being deployed:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nOnce it's fully up and running you should see all tasks and health checks being up:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n\nStep 2: Deploy Vamp\n\nOnce you have elasticsearch up and running it's time to move on to Vamp. The Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nCreate vamp.json with the following content:\n\n \n         \n      ],\n      \"forcePullImage\": true\n     \n   ,\n  \"labels\":  ,\n  \"env\":  ,  \n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis service definition will download our Vamp container and spin it up in your DC/OS cluster on a private node in bridge networking mode. It will also configure the apporiate labels for the AdminRouter to expose the UI through DC/OS, as well as an internal VIP for other applications to talk to Vamp, adjusting some defaults to work inside DC/OS, and finally a health check for monitoring.\n\nDeploy it with the CLI, like with did with elasticsearch:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add vamp.json\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n/vamp/vamp      1024  0.5    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nIt will take a minute for Vamp to deploy all its components, you can see that by looking in the \"tasks\" column, where Vamp is listed as 0/1. Run the list command again and you should see all the components coming online:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID                        MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD\n/elasticsearch            1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp                1024  0.5    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp-gateway-agent  256   0.2    3/3    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-health      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-kibana      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-metrics     64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-vga         64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n\nVamp has now spun up all it's components and you should be able to access the ui by opening http://dcos.example.com/service/vamp/ in your browser.\n\nNow you're ready to follow our Vamp getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

Before you begin, it is advisable to try out the official Quickstart for Google Container Engine tutorial first (google.com - container engine quickstart).  \n\n  \nKubernetes support is still in Alpha.\n  \n\nTested against\nThis guide has been tested on Kubernetes and kubectl 1.4.x and 1.5.

NB take a look into the available resources when a deployment keeps \"hanging\" to see if you actually have enough resources available.\nVamp currently only supports the 'default' namespace, so this should be available.\n\nCreate a new GKE cluster\n\nThe simple way to create a new GKE cluster:\n\nopen Google Cloud Shell\nset a zone, e.g. gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b\ncreate a cluster vamp using default parameters: gcloud container clusters create vamp\n\nAfter the (new) Kubernetes cluster is setup, we are going to continue with the installation using the Kubernetes CLI kubectl.\nYou can use kubectl directly from the Google Cloud Shell, e.g. to check the Kubernetes client and server version:\n\nkubectl version\n Quickstart\n\nTo quickly get started with Vamp on Kubernetes use the following command to automate the quick start described below (requires curl):\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.3/vampkubequickstart.sh \\\n  | bash\nThe script will poll for the external ip of Vamp, note that this process will take a while. if the installation was successful the ip will be displayed:\n\n$ [OK] Quickstart finished, Vamp is running on http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080\n\nWe don't recommend running this setup in production. You might want to add a HTTPS proxy in front of Vamp with at least basic authentication.\n\nTo remove the quickstart deployment, use the following command:\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.3/vampkubeuninstall.sh \\\n  | bash\n\nManual deployment\n\n Deploy etcd, Elasticsearch\n\nNow let's deploy etcd - this installation is based on the tutorial (github.com/coreos - etcd on Kubernetes).  Note that this is not a production grade setup - you would also need to take care of persistence and running multiple replicas of each pod.\nFirst, execute:\n\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.3/etcd.yml\n\nThen deploy Elasticsearch with a proper Vamp configuration (github.com/magneticio - elastic) using:\n\nkubectl run elasticsearch --image=elasticsearch:2.4.4\nkubectl run kibana --image=kibana:4.6.4 --env=\"ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200\"\nkubectl expose deployment elasticsearch --protocol=TCP --port=9200 --name=elasticsearch\nkubectl expose deployment kibana --protocol=TCP --port=5601 --name=kibana\n\nRun Vamp\n\nNow we can run Vamp gateway agent as a daemon set:\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.3/vga.yml\n\nTo deploy Vamp, execute:\n\nkubectl run vamp --image=magneticio/vamp:0.9.3-kubernetes\nkubectl expose deployment vamp --protocol=TCP --port=8080 --name=vamp --type=\"LoadBalancer\"\n\nAs a reference, you can find the latest Vamp katana  Kubernetes configuration here: github.com/magneticio - Vamp Kubernetes configuration. Vamp katana includes all changes since the last official release, check the katana documentation for details.\n\nThe Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nWait a bit until Vamp is running and check out the Kubernetes services:\n\nkubectl get services\n\nThe output should be similar to this:\n\nNAME                 CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)             AGE\nelasticsearch        10.3.242.188   none           9200/TCP            4m\netcd-client          10.3.247.112   none           2379/TCP            4m\netcd0                10.3.251.13    none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\netcd1                10.3.251.103   none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\netcd2                10.3.250.20    none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\nkubernetes           10.3.240.1     none           443/TCP             5m\nvamp                 10.3.242.93    146.148.118.45   8080/TCP            2m\nvamp-gateway-agent   10.3.254.234   146.148.22.145   80/TCP              2m\n\nNotice that the Vamp UI is exposed (in this example) on http://146.148.118.45:8080\nOn Minikube you can use the handy minikube service vamp command to open the Vamp UI in your browser.\nIn the Kubernetes dashboard under 'Services' you will see the external endpoint appear with a hyperlink icon behind it when the Vamp UI service is available.\n\n Deploy the Sava demo application\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2       \n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\nBe sure that the cluster has enough resources (CPU, memory), otherwise deployments will be in pending state. Once it's running we can check if all Vamp Gateway Agent services are up:\n\nkubectl get services --show-labels -l vamp=daemon\n\nWe can see that for each gateway a new service is created:\n\nNAME                      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE       LABELS\nhex1f8c9a0157c9fe3335e9   10.3.243.199   104.155.24.47   9050/TCP    2m        lookup_name=a7ad6869e65e9c047f956cf7d1b4d01a89e\nef486,vamp=gateway\nhex26bb0695e9a85ec34b03   10.3.245.85    23.251.143.62   40000/TCP   2m        lookup_name=6ace45cb2c155e85bd0c84123d1dab5a6cb\n12c97,vamp=gateway\n\n  \nIn this setup Vamp is deliberately configured to initiate exposure of all gateway and VGA ports. This would not be the case if the default and recommended setting are used.\n  \n\nNow we can access our sava service on http://104.155.24.47:9050\n\nIn the Kubernetes dashboard you will see the external endpoint appear with a hyperlink icon behind it in the \"Services\" overview when the external gateway of your deployment is available. You can recognise it by the port that's included in the endpoint that you have defined in your blueprint gateway definition.\n\nThe default Kubernetes service type can be set in configuration: vamp.container-driver.kubernetes.service-type, possible values are LoadBalancer or NodePort. We can also access gateways using virtual hosts. Vamp Gateway Agent service is on IP 146.148.22.145 in this example, so:\ncurl --resolve 9050.sava-1-0.vamp:80:146.148.22.145 -v http://9050.sava-1-0.vamp\n\nDon't forget to clean up your Kubernetes cluster and firewall rules  if you don't want to use them anymore (google.com - container engine quickstart: clean up).\n\n  \n\nOnce you have Vamp up and running you can jump into the getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

Navigate to Universe in the DC/OS UI and search for Vamp and click \"Install Package\".\n\nFor detailed steps on installing the Unvierse package refer to the tutorial here: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/vamp\n\n Manual install\nThis setup will run Vamp, Mesos and Marathon, together with Zookeeper and Elasticsearch on DC/OS.\n\nTested against  \nThis guide has been tested on the 1.8 and 1.9 version of DC/OS.\n\nRequirements  \nBefore you start you need to have a DC/OS cluster up and running, as well as the its CLI configured to use it. We assume you have it up and running on http://dcos.example.com/.\nSetting up DC/OS is outside the scope of this document, for that you need to refer to the official documentation:\n\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/usage/cli/\n\nStep 1: Install Elasticsearch\n\nMesos, Marathon and ZooKeeper are all installed by DC/OS. In addition to these, Vamp requires Elasticsearch for metrics collection and aggregation. If you don't have an Elasticsearch cluster setup already you can use the magneticio Docker images to deploy a compatible Vamp Elastic Stack (hub.docker.com - magneticio elastic)\n\nCreate elasticsearch.json with the following content:\n\n \n   ,\n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis will run the container with 1G of RAM and a basic health check on the elasticsearch port.\n\nUsing the CLI we can install this in our cluster:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add elasticsearch.json\n\nIf you get no error message you should now be able to see it being deployed:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nOnce it's fully up and running you should see all tasks and health checks being up:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n\n Step 2: Deploy Vamp\n\nOnce you have elasticsearch up and running it's time to move on to Vamp. The Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nCreate vamp.json with the following content:\n\n \n         \n      ],\n      \"forcePullImage\": true\n     \n   ,\n  \"labels\":  ,\n  \"env\":  ,  \n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis service definition will download our Vamp container and spin it up in your DC/OS cluster on a private node in bridge networking mode.

Before you begin, it is advisable to try out the official Quickstart for Google Container Engine tutorial first (google.com - container engine quickstart).  \n\n  \nKubernetes support is still in Alpha.\n  \n\nTested against\nThis guide has been tested on Kubernetes and kubectl 1.4.x, 1.5.x and 1.6.0.

NB take a look into the available resources when a deployment keeps \"hanging\" to see if you actually have enough resources available.\nVamp currently only supports the 'default' namespace, so this should be available.\n\nCreate a new GKE cluster\n\nThe simple way to create a new GKE cluster:\n\nopen Google Cloud Shell\nset a zone, e.g. gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b\ncreate a cluster vamp using default parameters: gcloud container clusters create vamp\n\nAfter the (new) Kubernetes cluster is setup, we are going to continue with the installation using the Kubernetes CLI kubectl.\nYou can use kubectl directly from the Google Cloud Shell, e.g. to check the Kubernetes client and server version:\n\nkubectl version\n Quickstart\n\nTo quickly get started with Vamp on Kubernetes use the following command to automate the quick start described below (requires curl):\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.4/vampkubequickstart.sh \\\n  | bash\nThe script will poll for the external ip of Vamp, note that this process will take a while. if the installation was successful the ip will be displayed:\n\n$ [OK] Quickstart finished, Vamp is running on http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080\n\nWe don't recommend running this setup in production. You might want to add a HTTPS proxy in front of Vamp with at least basic authentication.\n\nTo remove the quickstart deployment, use the following command:\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.4/vampkubeuninstall.sh \\\n  | bash\n\nManual deployment\n\n Deploy etcd, Elasticsearch\n\nNow let's deploy etcd - this installation is based on the tutorial (github.com/coreos - etcd on Kubernetes).  Note that this is not a production grade setup - you would also need to take care of persistence and running multiple replicas of each pod.\nFirst, execute:\n\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.4/etcd.yml\n\nThen deploy Elasticsearch with a proper Vamp configuration (github.com/magneticio - elastic) using:\n\nkubectl run elasticsearch --image=elasticsearch:2.4.4\nkubectl run kibana --image=kibana:4.6.4 --env=\"ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200\"\nkubectl expose deployment elasticsearch --protocol=TCP --port=9200 --name=elasticsearch\nkubectl expose deployment kibana --protocol=TCP --port=5601 --name=kibana\n\nRun Vamp\n\nNow we can run Vamp gateway agent as a daemon set:\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.4/vga.yml\n\nTo deploy Vamp, execute:\n\nkubectl run vamp --image=magneticio/vamp:0.9.4-kubernetes\nkubectl expose deployment vamp --protocol=TCP --port=8080 --name=vamp --type=\"LoadBalancer\"\n\nAs a reference, you can find the latest Vamp katana  Kubernetes configuration here: github.com/magneticio - Vamp Kubernetes configuration. Vamp katana includes all changes since the last official release, check the katana documentation for details.\n\nThe Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nWait a bit until Vamp is running and check out the Kubernetes services:\n\nkubectl get services\n\nThe output should be similar to this:\n\nNAME                 CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)             AGE\nelasticsearch        10.3.242.188   none           9200/TCP            4m\netcd-client          10.3.247.112   none           2379/TCP            4m\netcd0                10.3.251.13    none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\netcd1                10.3.251.103   none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\netcd2                10.3.250.20    none           2379/TCP,2380/TCP   4m\nkubernetes           10.3.240.1     none           443/TCP             5m\nvamp                 10.3.242.93    146.148.118.45   8080/TCP            2m\nvamp-gateway-agent   10.3.254.234   146.148.22.145   80/TCP              2m\n\nNotice that the Vamp UI is exposed (in this example) on http://146.148.118.45:8080\nOn Minikube you can use the handy minikube service vamp command to open the Vamp UI in your browser.\nIn the Kubernetes dashboard under 'Services' you will see the external endpoint appear with a hyperlink icon behind it when the Vamp UI service is available.\n\n Deploy the Sava demo application\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2       \n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\nBe sure that the cluster has enough resources (CPU, memory), otherwise deployments will be in pending state. Once it's running we can check if all Vamp Gateway Agent services are up:\n\nkubectl get services --show-labels -l vamp=daemon\n\nWe can see that for each gateway a new service is created:\n\nNAME                      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE       LABELS\nhex1f8c9a0157c9fe3335e9   10.3.243.199   104.155.24.47   9050/TCP    2m        lookup_name=a7ad6869e65e9c047f956cf7d1b4d01a89e\nef486,vamp=gateway\nhex26bb0695e9a85ec34b03   10.3.245.85    23.251.143.62   40000/TCP   2m        lookup_name=6ace45cb2c155e85bd0c84123d1dab5a6cb\n12c97,vamp=gateway\n\n  \nIn this setup Vamp is deliberately configured to initiate exposure of all gateway and VGA ports. This would not be the case if the default and recommended setting are used.\n  \n\nNow we can access our sava service on http://104.155.24.47:9050\n\nIn the Kubernetes dashboard you will see the external endpoint appear with a hyperlink icon behind it in the \"Services\" overview when the external gateway of your deployment is available. You can recognise it by the port that's included in the endpoint that you have defined in your blueprint gateway definition.\n\nThe default Kubernetes service type can be set in configuration: vamp.container-driver.kubernetes.service-type, possible values are LoadBalancer or NodePort. We can also access gateways using virtual hosts. Vamp Gateway Agent service is on IP 146.148.22.145 in this example, so:\ncurl --resolve 9050.sava-1-0.vamp:80:146.148.22.145 -v http://9050.sava-1-0.vamp\n\nDon't forget to clean up your Kubernetes cluster and firewall rules  if you don't want to use them anymore (google.com - container engine quickstart: clean up).\n\n  \n\nOnce you have Vamp up and running you can jump into the getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

Navigate to Universe in the DC/OS UI and search for Vamp and click \"Install Package\".\n\nFor detailed steps on installing the Unvierse package refer to the tutorial here: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/vamp\n\n Manual install\nThis setup will run Vamp, Mesos and Marathon, together with Zookeeper and Elasticsearch on DC/OS.\n\nTested against  \nThis guide has been tested on the 1.8 and 1.9 version of DC/OS.\n\nRequirements  \nBefore you start you need to have a DC/OS cluster up and running, as well as the its CLI configured to use it. We assume you have it up and running on http://dcos.example.com/.\nSetting up DC/OS is outside the scope of this document, for that you need to refer to the official documentation:\n\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/\nhttps://dcos.io/docs/1.8/usage/cli/\n\nStep 1: Install Elasticsearch\n\nMesos, Marathon and ZooKeeper are all installed by DC/OS. In addition to these, Vamp requires Elasticsearch for metrics collection and aggregation. If you don't have an Elasticsearch cluster setup already you can use the magneticio Docker images to deploy a compatible Vamp Elastic Stack (hub.docker.com - magneticio elastic)\n\nCreate elasticsearch.json with the following content:\n\n \n   ,\n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nThis will run the container with 1G of RAM and a basic health check on the elasticsearch port.\n\nUsing the CLI we can install this in our cluster:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add elasticsearch.json\n\nIf you get no error message you should now be able to see it being deployed:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nOnce it's fully up and running you should see all tasks and health checks being up:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n\n Step 2: Install a Relational Database\n\nIf the artifacts that are created by Vamp need to be persisted (available after restart and upgrades), than it is necessary to install one of the relational databases that Vamp supports. Currently, there is support for MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server. Pending on the choice of database, different universe packages are available for installing these databases on a DC/OS cluster. Also custom images or externally hosted databases can be used, as long it is available from the location where Vamp is running.\n\nStep 3: Deploy Vamp\n\nOnce you have elasticsearch and one of the supported relational databases up and running it's time to move on to Vamp. The Vamp UI includes mixpanel integration. We monitor data on Vamp usage solely to inform our ongoing product development. Feel free to block this at your firewall, or contact us if you’d like further details.\n\nIf you want Vamp to persist to one of the supported relational databases, create a vamp.json with the following content (the database configuration values may have to be adjusted to the specific relational database, this is for the standard DC/OS MySQL universe package):\n\n \n         \n      ],\n      \"forcePullImage\": true\n     \n   ,\n  \"labels\":  ,\n  \"env\":  ?useSSL=false\",\n    \"VAMPDBCREATE_URL\": \"jdbc:mysql://mysql.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:3306?useSSL=false\",\n    \"VAMPDBUSER\": \"root\",\n    \"VAMPDBPASSWORD\": \"root\"\n   ,\n  \"healthChecks\": [\n     \n  ]\n \n\nNote that the VAMPDBURL needs to contain the $  string interpolation. The VAMPDBCREATE_URL needs to connect either to the default database or in the case of MySQL no database needs to be specified. From that JDBC URI the needed Vamp database will be created. For different examples of other supported relational databases or in-memory only persistence see configuration reference.\n\nThis service definition will download our Vamp container and spin it up in your DC/OS cluster on a private node in bridge networking mode. It will also configure the apporiate labels for the AdminRouter to expose the UI through DC/OS, as well as an internal VIP for other applications to talk to Vamp, adjusting some defaults to work inside DC/OS, and finally a health check for monitoring.\n\nDeploy it with the CLI, like with did with elasticsearch:\n\n$ dcos marathon app add vamp.json\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID              MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD   \n/elasticsearch  1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None  \n/vamp/vamp      1024  0.5    0/1    0/0      scale       DOCKER   None  \n\nIt will take a minute for Vamp to deploy all its components, you can see that by looking in the \"tasks\" column, where Vamp is listed as 0/1. Run the list command again and you should see all the components coming online:\n\n$ dcos marathon app list\nID                        MEM   CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD\n/elasticsearch            1024  0.2    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp                1024  0.5    1/1    1/1       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/vamp-gateway-agent  256   0.2    3/3    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-health      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-kibana      64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-metrics     64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n/vamp/workflow-vga         64   0.1    1/1    ---       ---        DOCKER   None\n\nVamp has now spun up all it's components and you should be able to access the ui by opening http://dcos.example.com/service/vamp/ in your browser.\n\nNow you're ready to follow our Vamp getting started tutorials.\nThings still not running?

Before you begin, it is advisable to try out the official Quickstart for Google Container Engine tutorial first (google.com - container engine quickstart).  \n\n  \nKubernetes support is still in Alpha.\n  \n\nTested against\nThis guide has been tested on Kubernetes and kubectl 1.4.x, 1.5.x and 1.6.0.

NB take a look into the available resources when a deployment keeps \"hanging\" to see if you actually have enough resources available.\nVamp currently only supports the 'default' namespace, so this should be available.\n\nCreate a new GKE cluster\n\nThe simple way to create a new GKE cluster:\n\nopen Google Cloud Shell\nset a zone, e.g. gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b\ncreate a cluster vamp using default parameters: gcloud container clusters create vamp\n\nAfter the (new) Kubernetes cluster is setup, we are going to continue with the installation using the Kubernetes CLI kubectl.\nYou can use kubectl directly from the Google Cloud Shell, e.g. to check the Kubernetes client and server version:\n\nkubectl version\n Quickstart\n\nTo quickly get started with Vamp on Kubernetes use the following command to automate the quick start described below (requires curl):\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.5/vampkubequickstart.sh \\\n  | bash\nThe script will poll for the external ip of Vamp, note that this process will take a while. if the installation was successful the ip will be displayed:\n\n$ [OK] Quickstart finished, Vamp is running on http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080\n\nWe don't recommend running this setup in production. You might want to add a HTTPS proxy in front of Vamp with at least basic authentication.\n\nTo remove the quickstart deployment, use the following command:\n\ncurl -s \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.5/vampkubeuninstall.sh \\\n  | bash\n\nManual deployment\n\n Deploy etcd, Elasticsearch\n\nNow let's deploy etcd - this installation is based on the tutorial (github.com/coreos - etcd on Kubernetes).  Note that this is not a production grade setup - you would also need to take care of persistence and running multiple replicas of each pod.\nFirst, execute:\n\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.5/etcd.yml\n\nThen deploy Elasticsearch with a proper Vamp configuration (github.com/magneticio - elastic) using:\n\nkubectl run elasticsearch --image=elasticsearch:2.4.4\nkubectl run kibana --image=kibana:4.6.4 --env=\"ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200\"\nkubectl expose deployment elasticsearch --protocol=TCP --port=9200 --name=elasticsearch\nkubectl expose deployment kibana --protocol=TCP --port=5601 --name=kibana\n\nRun Vamp\n\nNow we can run Vamp gateway agent as a daemon set:\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticio/vamp.io/master/static/res/v0.9.5/vga.yml\n\nTo deploy Vamp, execute:\n\nkubectl run vamp --image=magneticio/vamp:0.9.4-kubernetes\nkubectl expose deployment vamp --protocol=TCP --port=8080 --name=vamp --type=\"LoadBalancer\"\n\nAs a reference, you can find the latest Vamp katana  Kubernetes configuration here: github.com/magneticio - Vamp Kubernetes configuration.

This means that we will do our utmost best to avoid breaking changes in our API's and DSL, focus even more on stabilising and optimising the current feature-set, while of course continuously introducing powerful new features.\n\nThe Vamp 0.9.0 release is the culmination of three months of hard work by our amazing team! This release incorporates nothing less than 115 issues and I'm very proud of what we've achieved.\n\nSome of the most notable new features are:\n\na brand new opensource UI with much better realtime graphs, sparklines, info, events panel and access to all relevant API objects like breeds, deployments but also new options like gateways and workflows.  \npowerful integrated workflows for automation and optimisation like autoscaling, automated canary-releasing etc. using efficient Javascript-based scripting.\nKubernetes and Rancher support.\nsupport for custom virtual host names in gateways.\nsupport for custom HAProxy templates.\na brand new Vamp Runner helper application for automated integration testing, mocking scenarios and educational purposes.  \n\nAnd, of course, there's a massive amount of improvements, bug fixes and other optimisations.\n\ngithub.com/magneticio - complete list of all the closed issues in this release\n\n  \nRead all release notes on github (github.com/magneticio - Vamp releases)\nYou can try out Vamp with our single container hello world package.\n  \n","id":164},{"path":"/documentation/release notes/version-0-9-1","date":"2016-10-01T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Version 0.9.1","content":"\n1st November 2016\n\nThe new stuff\nThis release of Vamp introduces:\n\nThe biggie: We've added Websockets support to our HTTP API. And we're now using this heavily in our new UI to improve responsiveness, smoothness and speed. https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/529\nWe've updated our UI to a nice dark theme due to public demand, we love it as it's much easier on the eyes, and of course we're very interested in hearing your thoughts!\nWe've updated our charts with the amazing Smoothie Charts library for smooth running charts and sparklines.\nYou can now configure Vamp to use a key-value store for persistence data storage. By default nothing is defined, and you need to choose either ElasticSearch or key-value. Take a look at the Vamp Quickstart configuration for possible settings. The design reasons for this addition are having less dependencies on Elasticsearch, better re-use of the available key-value stores that come with cluster-managers (like Zookeeper in DC/OS or Etcd in Kubernetes) and more robustness (i.e. if we temporarily loose ES the persistence data is still available in the K/V store, only the metrics data is temporarily unavailable). Possible issues might be the performance of the key-value store after some time. This is a known issue being investigated. https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/750\nGateway stickyness is now editable through the UI\nScales and gateways are seperate entities exposed through the UI\nMulti-select delete actions in the UI\nYou can now filter health and/or metrics events in the EVENTS stream panel\nAnd of course lots of other improvements and bug-fixes that can be found here: https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.9.1+is%3Aclosed\n\n What has changed\nBREAKING CHANGE: In the Vamp configuration the “rest-api” section has changed to “http-api”. When running Vamp 0.9.1 you need to change this setting accordingly. NB REST and websockets are both a part of our HTTP API. Check this Vamp configuration example.\nBREAKING CHANGE: The default value for Vamp Gateway Agent storeKey has /vamp/gateways/haproxy/1.6 - changed from /vamp/haproxy/1.6\nIn the Vamp configuration we set persistence caching by default to false. In our pre-build Vamp images we set this to true to make it easier on the persistence store load. https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/792\nWe've changed the updating deployment service states. https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/797\n\nKnown issues\nHealth in deployment detail screen stays at 100% even when a gateway error is measured. In the gateway detail screen this works correctly. \nMemory leak issues when running workflows.\nInstability when using Zookeeper in the Vamp quickstart packages after a period of time.\nWhen using Elasticsearch for persistence storage there can be stale data due to speed of the websockets implementation and slower / eventual indexing of ES. A browser refresh solves this.\nVamp-docker quickstart throws error when starting up.\n\nThe full list of improvements and bug-fixes that can be found here: https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.9.1+is%3Aclosed\n\n  \nRead all release notes on github (github.com/magneticio - Vamp releases)\nYou can try out Vamp with our single container hello world package.\n  \n","id":165},{"path":"/documentation/release notes/version-0-9-2","date":"2016-12-22T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Version 0.9.2","content":"\n22nd December 2016\n\nThis v0.9.2 release of Vamp has plenty of improvements in the areas of installation, robustness and stability.

Noticeable improvements are the redesigned UI with better support for larger deployments and lists due to a new list view and \"as you type\" search/filter. We moved the menu to the vertical left for better use of screen real-estate. We've added admin features to the UI to display logging, hot reloading of configurations and displaying the several layers of configurations. And very useful: all screens now have a context-sensitive help panel to the right.\n\nOn the backend side we now support configurable namespaces and service networks. We've solved a time-out issue in our UI implementation that was appearing when network packets would be chunked by the javascript engine. We've extended and improved our logging for better debugging, adding more log events and also streaming. The API now supports an additional endpoint, conditions, that can be referenced by name in the Vamp gateway routes. This helps to manage complex condition-rules.\n\nVamp 093 now supports HAproxy 1.7 and running multiple gateway configurations in parallel, including running several versions of HAproxy.\n\nWe replaced the original Vamp Gateway Agent agent binary with confd (magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent#7), added health-check endpoints to the VGA's, replaced logstash with elastic filebeat, and added elastic metricbeat to the Vamp Workflow Agents for better logging and debugging.\n\nWhat is new\nno-store pulse storage 869\nConfigurable service network #730\nUsing Vamp namespace in Docker labels #679\nSupport for HAproxy 1.7.x compatible configurations #871\nKey-value store for (additional) Vamp configuration and option to update Vamp configuration at runtime #872\nMultiple gateway marshallers and option to update VGA (HAProxy) templates at runtime #870.\nQuerying events by type #878\nCalculate scales by workflow #793\nShowing Vamp logs in UI #863\nKubernetes namespace support #667\nArtifact metadata #890\nVamp as reverse proxy to Vamp gateways #884\nLog all API request #898\nSupport for Kubernetes 1.5.x\n\nWhat has changed\nPulse storage type needs to be explicitly specified vamp.pulse.type: elasticsearch or no-store 869\nRemoved redundant HAProxy configuration: vamp.gateway-driver.haproxy.virtual-hosts, vamp.gateway-driver.haproxy.tcp-log-format and vamp.gateway-driver.haproxy.http-log-format #763.\nDebug API endpoints have been removed #308\nAPI endpoint to get HAProxy configuration and key-value key for VGA #870\nConfiguration change: vamp.workflow-driver.workflow.deployables.\"application/javascript\" has been changed to vamp.workflow-driver.workflow.deployables.application.javascript\nDefault workflow parameters are applied only on application/javascript workflows #880\n\nAdditions and changes to related Vamp components and projects\n Vamp Workflow Agent\n\nAdded elastic metricbeat https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent/issues/10\nUpgraded to Alpine 3.5 https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent/issues/11\n\nVamp Gateway Agent\nReplaced VWA binary with confd https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent/issues/7 https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent/issues/25\nAdded Runit for supervisor and init system https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent/issues/27\nReplaced logstash with filebeat https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent/issues/29\nAdded health check endpoints https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent/issues/21\n\n Vamp UI\nAdded pagination https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/177\nNew navigation https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/196\nBackend configuration panel https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/199\nFull info panel https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/202\nList view https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/204\nLog panel https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/203\nVGA configuration panel https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/201\nSearch option https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/182\nSupport for retina and hDPI screens https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/229\nSeveral improvements to design and UX https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/182\n\nKnown issues\nVamp 093 currently is not tested with the latest stable Rancher releases.

It shows the first features of our longer term vision on what Vamp can be and deliver. One of the most powerful additions is the addition of a Vamp controlled \"reverse proxy\" functionality. This enables powerful new features like showing logs of running container instances, showing the contents of the containers itself, and exposing event-logs from all the Vamp workflows, all directly within the Vamp UI. With this new feature Vamp can effectively act as a unified accesspoint and view to all the components and services running in the system. We've also added support for importing and converting Docker Compose files to Vamp blueprints. Another powerful addition is now defining health-definitions for Marathon within Vamp blueprints. Much requested is having a smart check on available cluster-resources in Marathon before deploying a blueprint. We have a service instances overview screen now, and better support for health-checks for Vamp containers. We also added an artifact revisions history view to the UI. And of course we've fixed plenty of bugs and added numerous enhancements and improvements along the way. Enjoy this new Vamp release and we look forward to building upon these great new core features to deliver even more powerful functionalities in the upcoming releases.  \n\nWhat is new\nVamp namespaces 927\nOptional DC/OS driver namespace cluster constraint #929\nDeployment level dialects #922\nWorkflow dialects #925\nVamp workflow agent port support and standalone UI #909 & #14\nWorkflow status endpoint #939\nAccess to configuration values from breed environment variables #906\nVamp JavaScript workflow agent breed as an external configurable breed #908\nAccess to workflow and deployment instances via Vamp reverse proxy #912\nUnique ID assigned to each event #907\nService-, cluster-, workflow- and breed level health checks DSL for Marathon\nNamespace based logging [#931] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/931)\nExtend Time unit to accept \"second\" and \"minute\" [#919] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/919)\nSupport for DC/OS 1.9.0\nHealth check suport in Vamp DSL (#709,\nCluster level health checks #914,\nSupport for workflow health checks #899,\nHealth on a breed level #913).\nTransform a docker-compose.yml to Blueprint (#928)\nAdditional blueprint validation #802\nUsing Kubernetes Jobs for event based workflows [#838] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues/838)\nVamp UI instance view [#299] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/299) \nVamp UI service detail view [#298] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/298)\nVamp UI artifact revisions view [#294] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/294)\nVamp UI show logs of containers [#280] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/280)\nVamp UI expose external workflow event log view inside UI panel [#206] (https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui/issues/206)\n\nWhat has changed\nSynchronization when health checks are changed needs to be explicitly specified vamp.operation.synchronization.check.health-check: true or false 709\nVamp JavaScript workflow breed configuration is removed from main configuration #908\nDialects must be specified inside a Dialects: tag.

Vamp workflows are containers with injected Node.js scripts that access the Vamp API for all kinds of automation and optimisation tasks. Vamp manages workflows just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. With very little effort you can use workflows to create valuable and powerful automation playbooks for testing and deployments. \n\nThis tutorial will show how workflows can be used to run an automated canary release, gradually introducing an updated service and initiating a rollback to the old version in case 500 errors are measured on the new service. We will use our nifty little demo and automation tool Vamp Runner to demonstrate this, but you could just as easily perform all the described actions manually in the Vamp UI or using the API.  \n\nIn this tutorial we will:\n\nRun Vamp with Docker Toolbox\nSpin up Vamp Runner  \nCreate a Blueprint and deploy some services \nCreate automation workflows\n  Generate traffic requests\n  Automate a canary release\nForce a rollback\nAutoscale services\nReset all actions\n\nRun Vamp with Docker Toolbox\n\n  \nThis tutorial has been tested on Vamp hello world v0.9.4 running on Docker Toolbox. \n  \n\nIf you are running Vamp hello world v0.9.4 together with Docker for Mac, you will need to install Docker Toolbox and run Vamp from the Docker Quickstart Terminal instead (docker.com - install Docker Toolbox).   \nA typical run command on Mac OS X with Docker Toolbox would be:\n\n      docker run --net=host \\\n              -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n              -v docker-machine ssh default \"which docker\":/bin/docker \\\n              -v \"/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup\" \\\n              -e \"DOCKERHOSTIP=$(docker-machine ip default)\" \\\n              magneticio/vamp-docker:0.9.4\n     \n Spin up Vamp Runner\nVamp Runner is the tool we use to demonstrate how individual Vamp features can be combined to fit real world use cases. This unlocks the real power of Vamp. We developed Vamp Runner as an automated integration testing tool to make sure important patterns of Vamp worked as expected against all supported container scheduling stacks when building new versions of Vamp. After we realised how powerful the concept of recipes was, we added a graphical UI on top for demonstration purposes. Vamp Runner can still be used in CLI mode though for your automated integration testing purposes. All actions triggered by Vamp Runner can also be triggered by your CI or automation tool of choice, check out the recipes folder in the Github project (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Runner recipes).\n\nOnce Vamp is up and running, you can deploy Vamp Runner alongside it (if you don’t already have a running version of Vamp, check the Vamp hello world set up ). Vamp Runner connects to the Vamp API endpoint, specified as VAMPRUNNERAPI_URL in the below docker run command. Note that the IP of your Vamp API location might be different, change this accordingly.\ndocker run --net=host \\\n        -e VAMPRUNNERAPI_URL=http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/v1 \\\n        magneticio/vamp-runner:0.9.4   \n\nYou can access the Vamp Runner UI at port 8088. \n\nThe available RECIPES (demos) are listed on the left  \n  Each recipe contains a number of steps that you can click through one by one. We are going to work through the recipe Canary Release - Introducing New Service Version\nThe RESET button allows you to quickly clear up all artifacts created by a recipe, we'll use that later on.                                                   \n\nCreate a blueprint and deploy some services\nVamp Runner will quickly create and deploy all the artifacts required for our canary release demo. If you prefer, you could create each artifact manually - click the INFO button to show the YAML used for each step or check the GitHub repo (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Runner recipes).\n\nSelect Canary Release - Introducing New Service Version from the RECIPES list.\n  \nClick RUN next to the first recipe step Create blueprint\n  Each recipe step must be performed in sequence\n  The INFO button next to each step shows you the exact YAML being posted to the VAMP API, in this case it shows us the blueprint that will be created\n  Once a step has completed successfully, the circle next to it will change from blue to green. If for whatever reason the desired state cannot be reached the circle will colour red. (NB check the recipe JSON definition file for each recipe the GitHub project recipes folder to examine the states that are defined to check if a step has been executed successfully.)\n\nWait for the Create blueprint step to complete and the circle to turn green, then work through the next four steps in turn:\n  Create breed and scale - creates the artifacts needed to deploy the service sava:1.0 (these are referenced in our placeholder blueprint)\n  Deploy blueprint - deploys the sava:1.0 service with a routing weight of 100% (all traffic)\n  Create gateway - exposes the external gateway 9050 mapped to our Sava deployment\n  Introduce new service version - merges the updated sava:1.1 with the running sava deployment. The new service variant is added to the existing Sava cluster with a route weight of 0% (no traffic)\n\n You can watch the created artifacts and deployments appear in the Vamp UI (or via the API) and, once deployed, you can access the sava service at the external gateway Vamp Runner created (9050).\n\n Create automation workflows\nWith two versions of our service ready to go, we can get started with some automation. Conveniently, Vamp Runner can set all this up for us. This recipe automates a canary release using two workflows:\n\na workflow to generate traffic requests (so we can see metrics and introduce 500 errors) \na workflow to adjust traffic distribution (for canary release and rollback). \n\nFirst, breeds are created with a Node.js script for each workflow. Next, workflows are created that reference the breeds. Vamp injects the JavaScript from the referenced breeds into workflow agent containers (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent) and these are deployed to run at the defined workflow schedule (continuously, triggered by Vamp events or at a set time). \n\nInside the deployed workflow containers, the Vamp Node.js client library enables JavaScript to easily speak with the Vamp API. See the gitHub project for details (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client) or read more about workflows\n\nWorkflow 1: Generate traffic requests\nThe next step is to get some traffic requests flowing into the deployed services.    \n\nClick RUN next to Generate traffic requests  \n  Vamp will create a breed and workflow named traffic. You can see the exact YAML posted to the Vamp API to complete this by clicking INFO.\n  \nThe created traffic workflow will send generated traffic requests to our services at the defined port (9050). The workflow is scheduled to run as a daemon, so it will begin generating traffic requests as soon as it is created. You can watch them arrive at the gateway in the Vamp UI.\n\nThe routing weights are currenctly set to sava:1.0 - 100% and sava:1.1 - 0%. This means that all incoming traffic will routed to sava:1.0. \n\n Workflow 2: Automate a canary release\nNow it's time to introduce sava:1.1 to the world by canary release. \n\nClick Run next to Automated canary release  \n  Vamp will create a breed and a workflow named canary. Go ahead and click INFO to see the YAML.\n  \n  \n\nOnce created, the canary workflow will begin to gradually rebalance traffic routing, introducing sava:1.1 while phasing out sava:1.0. You can see the weight distribution on the internal gateway updating in the Vamp UI.\n\nYou can also use the WEIGHT slider in the Vamp UI to adjust the weight manually, the canary workflow will kick back in and take over from your setting.\n\nForce a rollback\nAs there are generated traffic requests flowing in to the sava service, the canary workflow can track the health of the deployed services and initiate a rollback in case errors are detected. We can demonstrate this by maliciously destroying the sava:1.1 deployment from the Marathon UI, effectively forcing a full rollback to sava:1.0. The error limit in the canary workflow is set to 500, so this is what we need to generate to force a rollback.\n\nGo the Marathon UI (on port 9090) and find the sava:1.1 container running inside the sava group.\nSelect destroy to kill the container, this will cause the required 500 errors to appear\n\nYou will see the following happen:\n\nThe canary workflow will pick up on the errors for traffic routed to sava:1.1 and rebalance the routing weight to send 100% of traffic to sava:1.0. \nVamp's default health workflow will also pick up on the errors and show a drop in health to 0%\nMarathon will redeploy the sava:1.1 service as soon as possible \nVamp will update its routing rules to respect the new location(s) of the Sava 1.1 container in the cluster\nAfter 30 seconds of no errors, service health will return to 100% and the canary workflow will start the canary release process over again.\n\n Autoscale the services\nThe final step in this Vamp Runner recipe deploys a workflow to automatically scale the services as their weights are rebalanced. Go ahead and run this step too - we will explain more about how Vamp manages autoscaling in a future tutorial.\n\nClear up and move along\nYou can set Vamp back to its initial (clean) state at any step in a recipe. Click RESET to remove all deployments, gateways, workflows and static artifacts that have been created by the selected recipe. After clean up, the status of each recipe step will be reset, so you can start from the beginning again.\n\n Summing up\n\nNow you’ve got to grips with Vamp Runner and the power of workflows there’s surely no stopping you. You can try out the other Vamp Runner recipes (remember to clean up when you’re done) like autoscaling and mocking metrics. \n\nLooking for more of a challenge?\nJust for fun, you could try these:\n\nHow might you integrate workflow automated canary releasing into a CI pipeline?\nCould you apply the mock metrics and/or canary workflows used in this recipe to another project?\nCan you adapt the canary workflow so it is triggered by a new deployment of the Sava service?\n\n  \nWhat would you like to see for our next tutorial? let us know\nFind our more about using Vamp\n  \n\n","id":186},{"path":"/documentation/tutorials/create-a-workflow","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Create a workflow that generates events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Tutorials\"","    name":"   name: \"Create a workflow that generates events\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","content":"\nIn an earlier tutorial we showed how Vamp workflows can be used to automate all kinds of useful behaviour, for example to automate canary releasing with rollbacks, or autoscaling. In this tutorial, we will explain the Vamp workflow system in more detail and create a workflow that accesses the Vamp events system. We will first create and retrieve some custom events manually using the Vamp REST API, then create a simple workflow to automate these actions. Let's get started!\n\nRequirements\n\nA running version of Vamp 0.9.x (this tutorial has been tested on Vamp v0.9.4 hello world)\n\n The Vamp events system\nVamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events.  Vamp events consist of an event type, one or more event tags and an optional event value. They are described in the format:  \n\n['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type \n\nEvent types\nVamp works with a number of default event types and custom event types can also be created using the /events API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type event will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.\n\nDefault event types |  Description\n----------|-----,archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)\nsynchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)\nevent | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event\nhealth | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nmetrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nallocation | Generated by the allocation workflow and used to calculate resource usage\nworkflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner\n\n Event tags\nEach event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for stored events and are used for filtering searches and listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a :. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). generictag:specifictag\n\nEvent value\nThe event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If no value is specified, it will be blank\n\n Storing events\nVamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .  \nRead more about events\n\n  \nCreate events with the REST API\n\nThe /events endpoint of the Vamp API can be used to create and retrieve events. We are going to use this endpoint to create an event with the custom type helloapi. Note that custom event type names may only include alphanumerics, ‘’ and ‘-’.\n\nUse Postman or curl to POST the below JSON to the /api/v1/events endpoint.\n\n \nIf all runs to plan, you will receive a response from the API with the accepted JSON in the body. \n\n \n\nYou will notice that a timestamp has been added and the the event tag has been expanded. This means we will be able to search for this event using both the generic tag (tag1) and the combined generic:specific tag (tag1:tag2). If you check in the Vamp UI, you will see the created event show up in the EVENTS stream at the bottom of the screen (of course you need to open the events stream panel first :).\n\n Create events with a simple workflow\nThat's great - we stored our first event! Now let's take this a step further and create a workflow to automate the process.\n\nA bit about workflows\n\nVamp workflows are a convenient way of creating Node JS based scripts that run as containers and access the Vamp API. JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. You can schedule workflows to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times. You could also create your own workflows using your language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a docker container that can be deployed by Vamp.\n\nWe are going to create a workflow that runs as a daemon (i.e. all the time). We'll start by creating a breed with the required workflow-script and then deploy this as a Vamp workflow. Our workflow will simply store an event using the /events API endpoint, but you could also use Vamp workflows to aggregate and calculate metrics and send these out as events again, like the default “metrics” and “health” workflows and events that are used by the Vamp UI to create graphs. \n\n Create a breed \nThe breed will hold the JavaScript to be run for our workflow. It is always advisable to create a Vamp breed artifact containing the workflow script and then reference the breed from a workflow definition. Note that we have included the Vamp Node.js Client library, this will allow the Node.js application to easily interact with the Vamp API, see the gitHub project for more details (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client).\n\n  Go the Breeds page in the Vamp UI\n  Click Add\n  Paste in the below breed YAML and click Save\n\nname: hello_workflow\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    'use strict';\n\n    var vamp = require('vamp-node-client'); // required to interact with the Vamp API\n\n    var api = new vamp.Api(); // a new Vamp API object\n\n    // create a Vamp event - tag, value, event_type\n    api.event('tag1:tag2', 'optionalvalue', 'helloworkflow');   \n  \n\nDeploy the hello_workflow breed as a workflow\nAfter successfully saving the hello_workflow breed, we can create a workflow that references it. Once the workflow is created, the script from the breed will be deployed inside a Vamp workflow agent container. We will schedule our workflow to run as a daemon, so it will immediately start running and use environment variables to set the run interval (execution period) to 5 seconds.\n\nGo to the Workflows page in the Vamp UI \nClick Add (top right)\nPaste in the below workflow YAML and click Save\n\nname: hello_workflow\nbreed: hello_workflow\nenvironment_variables:\n  VAMPWORKFLOWEXECUTION_PERIOD: '5' \n  VAMPWORKFLOWEXECUTIONTIMEOUT: '4'   should be less than VAMPWORKFLOWEXECUTIONPERIOD\nschedule: daemon\nThe workflow will be deployed and you will see the created events appearing in the Vamp UI EVENTS stream. \n\nUpdate the running workflow\nUpdates made to a breed or workflow will not be directly carried over to the running workflow. To apply updates to a running workflow, it must be restarted. Let's update our running workflow so it creates an event every second. We will need to suspend it first as It is not possible to update workflows while they are running.\n \nGo the Workflows page in the Vamp UI\nOpen the action menu on the hello_workflow workflow and click Suspend  \n\nOpen the hello_workflow workflow and click Edit\nSet the VAMPWORKFLOWEXECUTION_PERIOD environment variable to 1 (this will cause the events to be generated every second)\nClick Save\nGo back to the Workflows page\nOpen the action menu on the hello_workflow workflow and click Start\n  The workflow will be restarted, applying the new changes \n\nCheck the events stream again. hello_workflow will now be generating events every second - that's a lot of events! Feel free to click Suspend to temporarily stop the workflow running or delete it completely.\n \n\n Retrieve and filter events using the REST API\nNow we have a lot of events stored we can use the same REST API /events endpoint to retrieve them. We can search for specific events and filter for specific types and tags. You can try this out in Postman or curl by sending a GET request to the /api/v1/events endpoint, you can even do this in your browser. Search through stored events using ?type= or ?tags= (following the tag format generic or generic:specifc). Note that it is not possible to filter for specific values.  \nSee using the Vamp API for details on pagination.\n\nThe API can also be used to retrieve an events stream /api/v1/events/stream\n\nSumming up\nYou should now know a bit more about the Vamp events system and how it is used by the distributed components of Vamp, such as workflows. Now you understand how to build, deploy and update your own workflows there should be no stopping you - what will you automate?\n\n Looking for more of a challenge?\nJust for fun, you could try these:\n\nCan you create a workflow that responds to a specific Vamp event?\nThe Vamp Node.js Client library also allows you to create workflows that measure and count metrics. How might you incorporate that functionality into an automation workflow? See the gitHub project for details (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client) or check the examples used in the Vamp runner recipes (github.com/magneticio - Vamp Runner recipes)\n\n  \nWhat would you like to see for our next tutorial? let us know\nFind our more about using Vamp\nRead more about the Vamp API\n  \n\n","id":187},{"path":"/documentation/tutorials/deploy-and-canary-release-wordpress","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deploy and canary release Wordpress","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Tutorials\"","    name":"   name: \"Deploy and canary release Wordpress\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","aliases":"aliases:","content":"Ths tutorial will demonstrate how Vamp builds deployments from artifacts and works with gateways. We'll do this by deploying Wordpress together with mySQL using official images from the Docker hub and setting up a gateway to run a canary release. We are going to use the Vamp UI, but you could just as easily perform all the described actions using the Vamp API.  \n\n  \nThis tutorial has been tested on Vamp hello world v0.9.3 running with Docker toolbox.\n  \n\nIn this tutorial we will:\n\nCreate a Wordpress blueprint and deploy it  \n  Create breeds to describe the mySQL and Wordpress deployables and their requirements\n  Create a scale to specify the resources to be assigned at runtime\n  Create a blueprint that combines breeds with scales \n  Deploy two instances of mySQL and Wordpress\nCanary release the deployments using gateways \n  Add stable endpoints to access the running Wordpress deployments\n  Control traffic distribution between the two deployments \n  Run a canary release\n\nRequirements\n\nA running version of Vamp (this tutorial has been tested on Vamp hello world v0.9.3 running with Docker toolbox)\nDocker machine should have access to at least 3GB memory\nAccess to the Docker hub\nYou might run into issues if your firewall is set to block connections in the ranges 31000-32000 (required by Mesos) or 40000-45000 (required by Vamp)\n  \n Create a Wordpress blueprint and deploy it\nDeployments to be initiated by Vamp are described in blueprints using the Vamp DSL (Domain Specific Language). A Vamp blueprint combines breed and scale artifacts to make scalable services, then groups these services into clusters for traffic distribution. \nA blueprint can reference individually stored artifacts, or everything can be described inline in the blueprint. We are going to create individual breed and scale artifacts, then reference these from our blueprint.\n\nCreate breeds\nServices to be deployed by Vamp must first be described in a breed. Breeds define the deployable to run and the internal gateway(s) to create for a single service. Settings can be specified in a breed and passed to the service at runtime, this is done using environment variables.  \nRead more about environment variables...\n\nFor our deployment, we will need to create two breeds - one for the mySQL database and one for Wordpress. We can use environment variables to specify the login credentials for the database and add some Vamp magic to tell Wordpress where it can find the as-yet-undeployed mySQL database. The Vamp variable host will resolve to the host or IP address of a referenced service at runtime. Finally, we can declare the mySQL database as a dependency for the Wordpress service so Vamp will wait until the database is available before it deploys Wordpress and all environment variables can be resolved.\n\nThe mySQL breed  \nWe will use mySQL as the Wordpress database, but you could try another database if you prefer. A quick check of the official documentation on the Docker hub tells us that the official mySQL container (hub.docker.com - mySQL) exposes the standard mySQL port (3306). We can create a database and set up some user accounts with the variables MYSQLDATABASE, MYSQLROOTPASSWORD, MYSQLUSER and MYSQL_PASSWORD. That's all the details we need to create a breed for the mySQL service. \n\n  In the Vamp UI, go the Breeds page \n  Click Add new\n  Paste in the below breed YAML and click Save\n\nname: mysql                     name of our breed\ndeployable: mysql:5.6          # publicly available Docker image\nports:\n  mysql_port: 3306/tcp         # internal gateway - the default mySQL port (tcp) \nenvironment_variables:         # required settings\n  MYSQLROOTPASSWORD: \"root_password\"\n  MYSQL_DATABASE: \"wordpress\"\n  MYSQLUSER: \"wordpressuser\"\n  MYSQLPASSWORD: \"wordpresspassword\"\n\nThe Wordpress breed  \nNow let's do the same for our Wordpress service. The official Wordpress container (hub.docker.com - wordpress) runs apache on port 80. We can specify an external database using the variables WORDPRESSDBHOST, WORDPRESSDBUSER and WORDPRESSDBPASSWORD. \n\n  In the Vamp UI, go the Breeds page \n  Click Add new\n  Paste in the below breed YAML and click Save\n\nname: wp:1.0.0                          # name of our Wordpress service\ndeployable: wordpress:4.6-php7.0-apache # publicly available Docker image        \nports:\n  webport: 80/http                      # internal gateway - the default apache port\nenvironment_variables:         \n  WORDPRESSDBHOST: $db.host:$db.ports.mysql_port\n  WORDPRESSDBUSER: \"wordpress_user\"\n  WORDPRESSDBPASSWORD: \"wordpress_password\"\ndependencies:                           # required for the Wordpress service to run\n  db: mysql                             # the mysql service from the db cluster\n\nNothing has been deployed yet, but you will be able to see the two new breeds listed in the Vamp UI on the Breeds page:\n\nCreate a scale\nScales define the resources to assign to a service, that is the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory. We are going to create one scale, which will be used by both of our breeds.\n\n  Go the Scales page\n  Click Add new\n  Paste in the below scale YAML and click Save\n\nname: demo\ninstances: 1\ncpu: 0.2\nmemory: 380MB  \n Create a blueprint\nNow we can create a simple blueprint that references our artifacts ready for deployment. A Vamp blueprint creates scalable services by joining togehter breed descriptions and a scale. Blueprints group services into clusters to allow easy distribution of incoming traffic - more on this later. \n\nOur blueprint will use two clusters - one for the database service and one for the Wordpress service.\n\nGo to the Blueprints page \nClick Add new\nPaste in the below blueprint YAML and click Save\n\nname: wp_demo            # name of our blueprint\nclusters:\n  db:                    # name of our database cluster\n    services:\n      breed: mysql       # reference to our mySQL breed\n      scale: demo        # reference to our stored scale\n  wp:                    # name of our Wordpress cluster\n    services:\n      breed: wp:1.0.0    # reference to our Wordpress breed\n      scale: demo        # reference to our stored scale\n\nVamp will store the blueprint and make it available for deployment. You will see it listed on the Blueprints page.\n\nDeploy the blueprint\nNow it's a simple click to deploy mySQL and Wordpress.\n\nFrom the Blueprints page, click Deploy as on the wp_demo blueprint\nYou will be prompted to give your deployment a name, let’s call it wp_demo_1\nClick Deploy to initiate the deployment\n\nVamp will now run the deployment. This might take some time, especially if the images need to be pulled from the Docker hub. You can track the status of the deployed clusters and their services on the Deployments page by clicking on the wp_demo_1 deployment. \n\nServices are grouped by cluster, with successfully deployed services highlighted in grey. The IP address of the deployed instance(s) and any environment variables passed to the service are also listed. Note that Vamp won't start to deploy Wordpress until mySQL has fully deployed, as we named the mySQL service as a dependency in the Wordpress breed.\n\n Deploy the blueprint again\nWe can quickly deploy a second instance of Wordpress and mySQL using our existing artifacts. Vamp breeds, scales and blueprints can be re-used to initiate as many deployments as you like. Each deployment will be treated as an individual entity and Vamp will manage all the internal gateways and routing, so you don't need to worry about creating conflicts with other running services or deployments - more on this later. \n\nGo to the Blueprints page \nClick Deploy as on the wp_demo blueprint\nName the deployment wp_demo_2\nClick Deploy to initiate the deployment\n\nWe now have two separate Wordpress deployments running, they should both be listed on the Deployments page:\n\nCanary release the deployments using gateways\nVamp exposes internal and external gateways to allow access to clusters of services. Internal gateways are automatically created dynamic endpoints, external gateways are declared stable endpoints. Weights and conditions can be applied to gateways to control the traffic distribution across multiple potential routes. For example, internal gateways can control traffic distribution across the services deployed in a cluster, whereas external gateways might control traffic distribution across routes not managed by Vamp.  \nRead more about gateway usage\n\nTo get back to our demonstration, we currently have two separate deployments running. In each of our deployments, Wordpress is connected to its own instance of mySQL via a mysql_port internal gateway. At deployment time, Vamp automatically creates new internal gateways for all the ports defined in the breed(s) deployed. This means that we have exposed a mysql_port and a webport internal gateway for each of our deployments. You can see all current exposed gateways on the Gateways page, they are labelled in the format deployment/cluster/port. \n\n...or in list view...\n\n Add stable endpoints\nWe could use the internal gateway ports to access our deployments if we wanted (go ahead and connect to the assigned ports for the wp_demo_1/wp/webport and wp_demo_2/wp/webport internal gateways, you should see your running Wordpress services). The ports assigned to internal gateways are, however, unpredictable, so it makes much more sense to declare stable endpoints ()external gateways) and access the services through these. \n\nWe can quickly add a new stable endpoint that maps to one of the existing Wordpress (webport) internal gateways.\n\nGo to the Gateways page\nClick Add new\nPaste in the below gateway YAML and click Save\n\n,name: wpdemo1_gateway   # name of our gateway\nport: 9050/http           # external gateway to expose\nroutes:\n  wpdemo1/wp/webport:   # the internal gateway exposed by the Wordpress breed\n    weight: 100%          # all traffic will be sent here\n\nThe gateway will be exposed and you can directly - and forever - access your Wordpress service at the specified 9050 port. \n\nHello Wordpress! Go ahead and finish the installation - I hear it's very quick - then you can check out your new site.\n\nLet's do that again\nAs we are running two deployments, we also need two external gateways - one for each instance of Wordpress. Let's add a second external gateway to give our other Wordpress service a stable endpoint, this time we'll need to expose a different port.\n\nGo to the Gateways page again\nClick Add new\nPaste in the below gateway YAML and click Save\n\n,name: wpdemo2_gateway    name of our gateway\nport: 9060/http           # external gateway to expose\nroutes:\n  wpdemo2/wp/webport:   # the internal gateway exposed by the Wordpress breed\n    weight: 100%          # all traffic will be sent here\nThe new gateway will be listed on the Gateways page and you can access your second Wordpress site on the newly exposed 9060 port (the old Wordpress site will still be available at port 9050). Complete this second Wordpress installation and make some changes to the site - select a different theme or add some content to help you easily tell the two deployments apart.  \n\nUse a gateway to distribute incoming traffic\nWell that was fun, but Vamp can do so much more! We can use our deployments to demonstrate some of Vamp's traffic distribution features and show how these can be used to run a canary release.\n\nVamp distributes traffic between services at shared gateways. If our Wordpress services had been running in the same deployment and cluster with a shared internal gateway, we could have used the shared internal gateway's WEIGHT slider to distribute traffic between them. As we are working with two separate deployments, we need to create a shared external gateway first. This is much the same as exposing a stable endpoint, only this time we will add two routes to the gateway and use the weight setting to distribute traffic between them. You can add as many routes as you like to a gateway, just remember that the total weight must always add up to 100%. \n\nGo to the Gateways page again\nClick Add new\nPaste in the below gateway YAML and click Save\n\n,name: wordpressdistributiongateway\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  wpdemo1_gateway:\n    weight: 50%      send 50% of all traffic to this route\n  wpdemo2_gateway:\n    weight: 50%     # send 50% of all traffic to this route\n\nThe gateway wil be created. Go to port 9070 and see which Wordpress install you are sent to. \n\n  \nYou might notice that the URL in your browser switched to either :9060 or :9050 and that subsequent visits to the 9070 endpoint consistently send you back to the same port/Wordpress. So what's going on with our gateway? Visits to 9070 should be split 50% / 50% between our two Wordpress instances! Here's where things get sticky, but that's not down to Vamp.  \n\nOn your first visit via 9070, Wordpress picked up that you had been redirected and sent out the HTTP response 301, which means \"permanently moved\"\nYour browser cached this 301 redirect and is now automatically sending every subsequent attempt to visit 9070 to the same destination \n  \nSimply disabling the cache won't help, but you can get around this by adding, for example, a ? to the end of the URL (e.g. 192.168.99.100:9070?). If you prefer a more eloquent solution, you could install a Wordpress plugin to prevent the 301 from happening in the first place (wordpress.org - Permalink Fix & Disable Canonical Redirects will do the trick), just remember to install it on both of your Wordpress deployments.\n  \n\nOnce you do make it back to the Vamp external gateway at 9070 you will see that everything is working as expected and you will be sent to 9050 or 9060 alternately. Thankyou Wordpress.\n\nRun a canary release  \nNow we have an external gateway set up with two routes, we can use the WEIGHT slider on the wordpress_distribution_gateway page to adjust the distribution of traffic between them. This will allow us to canary release our new Wordpress site to users, introducing it gradually and quickly switching back if it doesn't perform as planned. Conditions can also be added to each route in the gateway to target specific user groups and route them to a specific version version.  \nRead more about using conditions\n \n\n Summing up\nYou should now understand a bit more about how Vamp builds deployments from the various artifacts, resolves variables and handles internal routing. Obviously, this is not a production grade setup. The database is running in a containerised mySQL instance with no data persistence. If you're running in the Vamp hello world setup, you're also likely to hit resource problems pretty quickly. If things aren't working as expected you can try increasing the memory of Docker VirtualBox VM (3GB should be enough for this demo).\n\nLooking for more of a challenge?\nJust for fun, you could try these:\n\nCan you rewrite the Wordpress and mySQL deployment as a single blueprint (define artifacts inline)?\nCan you run this deployment using the Vamp API?\n  There are full instructions in deploy your first blueprint - using the API or you can check the API reference \nTry adding a condition to the 9070 external gateway - for example, to send all Firefox users to one version of your site and everyone else to the other\n  Read about using conditions\nCould you set up external gateways for the mySQL deployments and connect Wordpress to the mySQL server running in the other deployment?\n\n  \nWhat would you like to see for our next tutorial? let us know\nFind our more about using Vamp\n  \n\n","id":188},{"path":"/documentation/tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deploy your first blueprint","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Tutorials\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","content":"If everything went to plan, you should have your Vamp installation up and running.

Your app normally runs on port 8080 but you want to expose it under port 9050 in this case. Let's deploy this through Vamp using the following simple blueprint. Don't worry too much about what means what: we'll get there. You can choose to deploy this blueprint either using the Vamp UI or using the Vamp API.\n\nname: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: sava/webport\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          webport: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2       \n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\n Deploy using the Vamp UI\n\nIn the Vamp UI, go to the Blueprints page and click Add (top right)\nPaste in the above blueprint and click Save.

Take care to set the correct Content-Type: application/x-yaml header on the POST request. Vamp is kinda strict with regard to content types, because we support JSON and YAML so we need to know what you are sending.   \n\ncurl:\ncurl -v -X POST --data-binary @sava_1.0.yaml -H \"Content-Type: application/x-yaml\" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments\n\nhttpie:\nhttp POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments Content-Type:application/x-yaml < sava_1.0.yaml\n\nAfter POST-ing, Vamp should respond with a 202 Accepted message and return a JSON blob. This means Vamp is trying to deploy your container. You'll notice some parts are filled in for you, like a default scale, a default routing and of course a UUID as a name.\nYou can also use the RESTful API to create a deployment with a custom name - simple PUT request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments/DEPLOYMENTCUSTOMNAME\n\n Check out the deployed application \n\nYou can follow the deployment process of our container by checking the /api/v1/deployments endpoint and checking when the state field changes from ReadyForDeployment to Deployed. You can also check Marathon's GUI (see the full list of all services exposed in the hello world setup).\n\nWhen the application is fully deployed, you can check it out through the Vamp UI. It should report a refreshing hipster lorem ipsum upon each reload (HipsterJesus.com):\n\nFrom the Deployments page:  \n  Click on sava to open the deployment detail screen, then click on sava:1.0.0 to see all running instances of the sava service (we only have one instance running right now). Click an instance name to open it.\n\nFrom the Gateways page:  \n  Open the internal gateway (sava/sava/webport) or the external gateway (sava/9050) and click the HOST - PORT/TYPE\n\nBy reverse proxy:  \n  You can also use Vamp as a reverse proxy to access the application through the exposed sava gateways:\n\n  http://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2Fsava%2Fwebport/\n  http://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2F9050/\n\nGet some metrics on the running application\n\nOpen the application in a new tab and hit refresh a few times in your browser. You should see the metrics spike and some pretty charts being drawn on the sava/9050 gateway page:\n\n Change scale and load balancing\n\nVamp will automatically load balance traffic across service instances as they scale. Let's change the scale of the sava service and see what happens. \n\nGo back to the Deployments page \nOpen the sava deployment and click the sava:1.0.0 service\nClick Scale service (top right) and set the INSTANCES to *3* \nClick Save \n\nVamp will automatically scale up the number of running instances (of course permitting underlying resources) and load balance these to the outside world using the gateway feature. Refresh the sava:1.0.0 service detail page to see all three running instances.\n\nChaos monkey\n\nNow let's try something fun. Go to the Marathon UI (on port 9090) and find the Sava container running. Now select destroy to kill the container. Watch Vamp detecting that issue and making sure that the defined number of instances is spun up again as soon as possible, while making sure the load balancing routing rules are also updated to reflect the changed IPs and ports of the instances.\n\n  \nLet's run a canary release in the second part of this getting started tutorial →\n  \n\n","id":189},{"path":"/documentation/tutorials/merge-and-delete","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Merge and delete","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Tutorials\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\nIn the previous tutorial we \"over-engineered\" our service based solution a bit (on purpose of course). We don't really need two backends services, so in this tutorial we will introduce our newly engineered solution and transition to it using Vamp blueprints and canary releasing methods. In this tutorial we will:\n\nGet some background and theory on merging services\nPrepare our blueprint\nMerge the new topology with the running deployment\nDecommission parts of the deployment\nAnswer the all important question when would I use this?\n\nRequirements: Docker machine should have access to at least 3GB memory\n\nSome background and theory\n\nWhat we are going to do is create a new blueprint that is completely valid by itself and merge it\nwith our already running deployment. This might sound strange at first, but it makes sense. Why? Merging will enable us to slowly move from the previous solution to the next solution. Once moved over, we can\nremove any parts we no longer need, i.e. the former \"over-engineered\" topology.\n\nIn the diagram above, this is visualized as follows:\n\nWe initiate a running deployment by deploying Blueprint A\nWe introduce a new service to the deployment by merging Blueprint B with the running deployment.\nAt this point, both blueprints are active allowing for a smooth transition, for example, by canary release.\nOnce we are fully on running on Blueprint B, we can remove/decommission Blueprint A\n\n Prepare our blueprint\n\nThe below blueprint describes our more reasonable service topology. This blueprint is completely valid by itself - you could just deploy it somewhere separately and not merge it with the over-engineered sava:1.2 topology.\n\nNotice the following:\n\nThere is only one backend cluster, with one service\nNo gateway is specified (we will use the existing gateway in the running deployment)\n\nname: sava:1.3\nclusters:\n  sava: # cluster 1\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava-frontend:1.3.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava-frontend:1.3.0\n        ports:\n          webport: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.webport/api/message\n        dependencies:\n          backend: sava-backend:1.3.0\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2\n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n  backend: # cluster 2\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava-backend:1.3.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava-backend:1.3.0\n        ports:\n          webport: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2\n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\nMerge the topologies\n\nWe can now merge the blueprint describing our new topology with the running sava-new deployment. This is done in the same way we added a new service in the run a canary release tutorial.  Merging the blueprint will deploy the new sava:1.3 services alongside sava:1.2, without routing any traffic to them.\nYou can complete the merge using either the Vamp UI or API.\n\n Merge using the Vamp UI\n\nGo to the Blueprints page and click Add (top right)\nPaste in the above blueprint and click Save. Vamp will store the blueprint and make it available for deployment\nOpen the action menu on the sava:1.3 blueprint and select Merge to\n  \nYou'll be prompted to select the deployment you wish to merge the blueprint with - select sava-new\nClick Merge to deploy the services sava:1.3 and sava-backend:1.3 to the running sava-new deployment.\n\nMerge using the API\n\nYou can complete the same merge action with the Vamp API - remember to set the Content-Type: application/x-yaml for your requests:\n\nTo create the blueprint, POST the above blueprint YAML to /api/v1/blueprints\nTo merge the blueprint, PUT the below YAML to /api/v1/deployments/sava-new\n\n    name: sava:1.3\n  \n\nSo what happened here? Vamp worked out which parts of the blueprint were already in the deployment and which parts should be added. This is done based on naming. The sava cluster already existed, so Vamp simply added a service to it with 0% route weight. A cluster named \"backend\" didn't exist, so Vamp created it.\n\nNotice we now have:\n\nThree backend clusters: two old ones (backend1 and backend2) and one from the new merge.\nTwo services in the sava cluster: the old sava-frontend:1.2 and the new sava-frontend:1.3.\n  If you open the sava cluster webport you will see that the sava-frontend:1.2.0 route has a weight of 100% and the new new sava-frontend:1.3.0 route has a weight of 0%. Whenever Vamp merges a new service to an existing cluster, the default weight of 0% is applied. This means no traffic will be routed to sava:1.3 yet.\n\nNow both blueprints are deployed, moving from the old to the new topology is just a question of “turning the weight dial”. You could do this in one go, or slowly adjust it.\n\n Decommission parts of the deployment\n\nOnce we are fully running on sava:1.3, we can decommission the old, over-engineered sava:1.2.  We do this by updating the deployment again, this time to remove the sava:1.2 blueprint, effectively deleting all deployed sava:1.2 services.\n\nNote that we won't be able to remove any service unless its weight is first set to 0%.\n\nDelete using the Vamp UI\n\nGo to the Blueprints page\nOpen the action menu on the sava:1.2 blueprint and select Remove from\n  \nYou'll be prompted to select the deployment you wish to remove the blueprint from - select sava-new\nClick Remove to delete the services sava:1.2, sava-backend1:1.2 and sava-backend2:1.2 from the running sava-new deployment.\n\n Delete using the API\n\nYou can complete the same delete action with the Vamp API - remember to set the Content-Type: application/x-yaml for your requests:\n\nTo delete the sava:1.2 blueprint from the deployment, DELETE the below YAML to /api/v1/deployments/sava-new\n\n    name: sava:1.2\n  \n\nVamp will update the running deployment, removing all elements described in the sava:1.2 blueprint. This means that our running deployment sava-new now contains no sava:1.2 services.\n\nWhen would I use this?\n\nSounds cool, but when would I use this in practice? Well, basically anytime you release something new!\n\nFor example a bugfix release for a mobile API that \"didn't change anything significantly\"? You could test this separately and describe it in its own blueprint. After testing, you would merge that exact same blueprint with your already running production version (the one without the bugfix) and slowly move over to new version.\n\nNew major release of your customer facing app? You probably also have some new dependencies that come with that release. You create some containers and write up a blueprint that describes this new situation, run it in acceptance and test and what have you. Later, you merge it into your production setup, effectively putting it next to it and then slowly move from the old situation to the new situation, including dependencies.\n\n  \n\nThis is the end of this initial getting started tutorials.

If you haven't walked through that part already, please do so before continuing.\n\nNow let's say we have a new version of this great application that we want to canary release into production. We have it containerised as magneticio/sava:1.1.0 and are ready to go. In this tutorial we will:\n\nPrepare our blueprint\nDeploy the new version of our application next to the old one\nCanary release the new application\nUse conditions to target specific groups\nLearn a bit more about conditions\n\nRequirements: Docker machine should have access to at least 3GB memory\n\nPrepare our blueprint\n\nVamp allows you to canary release application updates by merging new blueprints to a running deployment. Take a look at the YAML blueprint example below. It is almost identical to the blueprint we initially used to deploy sava 1.0.0, with one difference - this time the breed describes the sava:1.1.0 service.\n\nname: sava:1.1\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.1.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n        ports:\n          webport: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2       \n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n\n Deploy the new version of our application next to the old one\n\nLet's introduce sava:1.1.0 to the running sava deployment.  \nWe can merge the above blueprint to deploy sava:1.1.0 alongside the existing sava:1.0.0. The merge will not affect the running service and initially no traffic will be routed to the new sava:1.1.0.\n\nMerge using the UI\n\nGo to the Blueprints page and click Add (top right)\nPaste in the above blueprint and click Save. Vamp will store the blueprint and make it available for deployment \nOpen the action menu on the sava:1.1 blueprint and select Merge to \n  \nYou'll be prompted to select the deployment you wish to merge the blueprint with - select sava\nClick Merge to deploy the sava:1.1.0 service to the running sava deployment.  \n  Vamp will work out the differences and update the deployment accordingly.\n  \n\n Merge using the API\n\nYou can complete the same merge action with the Vamp API - remember to set the Content-Type: application/x-yaml for your requests:\n\nTo create the blueprint, POST the above blueprint YAML to /api/v1/blueprints  \nTo merge the blueprint, PUT the below YAML to /api/v1/deployments/sava  \n\n    name: sava:1.1\n  \nCanary release\nWhen Vamp has finished deploying, open the sava/sava/webport gateway.  You will see two routes listed - one for the sava:1.0.0 service and one for the new sava:1.1.0 service. The weight of our newly merged service is set to 0%, this means that no traffic is currently being routed here. Whenever Vamp merges a new service to an existing cluster it applies the default weight of 0%.  \nLet's adjust the weight and start to send traffic to our new sava:1.1.0\n\nClick the edit icon next to WEIGHT\nAdjust the weight slider to distribute traffic 50% / 50% between the two services\n  \nClick Save and Vamp will update the load balancing rules accordingly\nClick the HOST - PORT/TYPE to open the gateway.  \n  Each time you do this the application will switch between a 1.0 page and a 1.1 page. \n\nYou can also use Vamp as a reverse proxy to access the exposed sava gateways (note that this works best with the \"Incognito\" or \"Anonymous\" mode of your browser because of the caching of static assets):\n  \nhttp://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2Fsava%2Fwebport/\nhttp://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2F9050/\n\n Use conditions to target specific groups\n\nUsing percentages to divide traffic between versions is already quite powerful, but also very simplistic.\nWhat if, for instance, you want to specifically target a group of users? Or channel specific requests\nfrom an internal service? Vamp allows you to do this right from the blueprint DSL.\n\nLet's start simple: We can use the Vamp UI to allow only Chrome users to access v1.1.0 of our application.\n\nGo to the Gateways page and open the sava/sava/webport gateway\nClick the edit condition icon for the sava/sava/sava:1.1.0/webport route and enter the condition User-Agent = Chrome\n\n  Now we need to set a strength for the condition.  \n  As we want all Chrome users to be sent to this route, we will set the condition strength to 100%.\nClick the edit condition strength icon for the sava/sava/sava:1.1.0/webport route and move the slider to 100%.\n\n  Finally, we need to account for routing of traffic that does not match the condition (that is, all non-Chrome users). We do this using the route weight.  \n  As we want only Chrome users to be sent to the sava/sava/sava:1.1.0/webport route, we need to set its route weight to 0%. That might sound confusing, but remember that the route weight is used for distributing traffic that didn't match the applied condition - and we want 0% of all non-Chrome users to be sent to the sava/sava/sava:1.1.0/webport route  \n  Read more about route weight and condition strength\nClick the edit icon next to WEIGHT\nAdjust the weight slider to 0% for the sava/sava/sava:1.1.0/webport route\n    \nClick Save\n\nAs we are not actually deploying anything, just reconfiguring routes, the update should be almost instantaneous. You can fire up a Chrome browser and a Safari browser and go to http://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2Fsava%2Fwebport/ to check the results. A hard refresh might be necessary because of your browser's caching routine.\n\nA bit more about conditions\n\nOur browser example is easily testable on a laptop, but of course a bit contrived. Luckily you can\ncreate much more powerful conditions quite easily. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5 - ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the 'condition` field.\n\n Vamp short codes\n\nACLs can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following, but we will be expanding on this in the future:\n\nUser-Agent = string\nHost = string\nCookie cookie name Contains string\nHas Cookie cookie name\nMisses Cookie cookie name\nHeader header name Contains string\nHas Header header name\nMisses Header header name\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nhdr_sub(user-agent) Android   # straight ACL\nuser-agent=Android            # lower case, no white space\nUser-Agent=Android            # upper case, no white space\nuser-agent = Android          # lower case, white space\n\nAdd multiple conditions\nMultiple conditions can be included using boolean expressions. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header \"X-VAMP-TUTORIAL\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\ngateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-TUTORIAL\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-TUTORIAL:stuff\n\n  \nCool stuff. But we are dealing here with single, monolithic applications. Where are the microservices?  We will chop up this monolith into services and deploy them with Vamp in the third part of our tutorial →\n  \n","id":192},{"path":"/documentation/tutorials/split-a-monolith","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Split a monolith","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Tutorials\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"In the previous tutorial we did some basic canary releasing on two versions of a monolithic application.

This will also help us demonstrate how we can later remove parts of our solution using Vamp. For now, we'll split the monolith into a topology of one frontend and two separate backend services. After our engineers are done with coding, we can catch this new topology in the following blueprint. Please notice a couple of things:\n\nWe now have three clusters: sava, backend1 and backend2. Each cluster can have multiple services for canary release and traffic filtering\nThe sava cluster has explicit dependencies on the two backends.

The exposed host and port are actually service\nendpoints. The location, amount and version of containers running behind that service endpoint can vary.\nLearn more about how Vamp does service discovery.\n\n  \nGreat!

This means you reference your breeds (or define them inline) and add runtime configuration to them.\n\nBlueprints allow you to add the following extra properties:\n\nGateways: a stable port where the service can be reached.\nClusters and services: a cluster is a grouping of services with one purpose, i.e. two versions (a/b) of one service.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nDialects: a dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform, i.e. Docker or Mesosphere Marathon.\nScale: the CPU and memory and the amount of instance allocate to a service.\nConditions: how traffic should be directed based on HTTP and/or TCP properties.\nSLA and escalations: SLA definition that controls autoscaling.\n\nExample - key concepts of blueprints\n\n,name: my_blueprint                         Custom blueprint name\ngateways:\n  8080/http: my_frontend/port\nclusters:\n  my_frontend:                            # Custom cluster name.\n  \n    gateways:                             # Gateway for this cluster services.\n      routes:                             # Makes sense only with\n        somecoolbreed:                  # multiple services per cluster.\n          weight: 95%\n          condition: User-Agent = Chrome\n        someotherbreed:                 # Second service.\n          weight: 5%\n          \n    services:                             # List of services\n      breed:\n          ref: somecoolbreed\n        scale:                            # Scale for this service.\n          cpu: 2                          # Number of CPUs per instance.\n          memory: 2048MB                  # Memory per instance (MB/GB units).\n          instances: 2                    # Number of instances\n      breed: \n          ref: someotherbreed           # Another service in the same cluster.  \n        scale: large                      # Notice we used a reference to a \"scale\". \n                                          # More on this later.\n\nGateways\n\nA gateway is a \"stable\" endpoint (or port in simplified sense) that almost never changes. When creating the mapping, it uses the definition (my_frontend/port in this case) from the \"first\" service in the cluster definition you reference. This service can of course be changed, but the gateway port normally doesn't.\n\nPlease take care of setting the /tcp or /http (default) type for the port. Using /http allows Vamp to record more relevant metrics like response times and metrics.\n\nRead more about gateways.\n\n  \ngateways are optional. You can just deploy services and have a home grown method to connect them to some stable, exposable endpoint.\n  \n\n Clusters and services\n\nIn essence, blueprints define a collection of clusters.\nA cluster is a group of different services, which will appear as a single service and serve a single purpose.\n\nCommon use cases would be service A and B in an A/B testing scenario - usually just different\nversions of the same service (e.g. canary release or blue/green deployment).\n\nClusters are configured by defining an array of services. A cluster can be given an arbitrary name. Services are just lists or arrays of breeds.\n\n,mycoolcluster\n  services\n   breed: \n      ref: mycoolservice_A      # reference to an existing breed\n   breed:                       # shortened inline breed\n       name: mycoolservice_B\n       deployable: some_container\n       ...\n\nClusters and services are just organisational items. Vamp uses them to order, reference and control the actual containers and gateways and traffic.\n\n This all seems redundant, right? We have a reference chain of blueprints - gateways - clusters - services - breeds - deployable. However, you need this level of control and granularity in any serious environment where DRY principles are taken seriously and where \"one size fits all\" doesn't fly.\n\nDialects\n\nVamp allows you to use container driver specific tags inside blueprints. We call this a “dialect”.  Dialects effectively enable you to make full use of, for instance, the underlying features like mounting disks, settings commands and providing access to private Docker registries.\n\nWe currently support the following dialects:\n\ndocker:\nmarathon:\n\n Docker dialect\n\nThe following example show how you can mount a volume to a Docker container using the Docker dialect.\n\nExample blueprint - using the Docker dialect\n\n,name: busybox\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox-breed\n        deployable: busybox:latest\n      docker:\n        Volumes:\n          \"/tmp\": ~\n\nVamp will translate this into the proper API call. Inspecting the container after it's deployed should show something similar to this:\n\n...\n\"Volumes\":  ,\n...    \n\n Marathon dialect\n\nThis is an example with Marathon that pulls an image from private repo, mounts some volumes, sets some labels and gets run with an ad hoc command: all taken care of by Marathon.\n  \nWe can provide the marathon: tag either on the service level, or the cluster level. Any marathon: tag set on the service level will override the cluster level as it is more specific. However, in 9 out of 10 cases the cluster level makes the most sense. Later, you can also mix dialects so you can prep your blueprint for multiple environments and run times within one description.\n\nexample blueprint - using the Marathon dialect\n\nNotice the following:\n\nUnder the marathon: tag, we provide the command to run in the container by setting the cmd: tag.\nWe provide a url to some credentials file in the uri array. As described in the Marathon docs (mesosphere.github.io/marathon - using a private Docker repository) this enables Mesos\nto pull from a private registry, in this case registry.example.com where these credentials are set up.\nWe set some labels with some arbitrary metadata.\nWe mount the /tmp to in Read/Write mode.\n\n,name: busy-top:1.0\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox\n        deployable: registry.example.com/busybox:latest\n      marathon:\n       cmd: \"top\"\n       uris:\n         \"https://somehost/somepath/somefilewithdockercredentials\"\n       labels:\n         environment: \"staging\"\n         owner: \"buffy the vamp slayer\"\n       container:\n         volumes:\n           containerPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             hostPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             mode: \"RW\"\n\n Scale\n\nScale is the \"size\" of a deployed service. Usually that means the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory.\n\nScales can be defined inline in a blueprint or they can defined separately and given a unique name. The following example is a scale named \"small\". POST-ing this scale to the /scales REST API endpoint will store it under that name so it can be referenced from other blueprints.\n\nExample scale\n\n,name: small    Custom name.\n\ncpu: 2        # Number of CPUs per instance.\nmemory: 2gb   # Memory per instance, MB/GB units.\ninstances: 2  # Number of instances.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp deployments\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":195},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/breeds","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Breeds","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds are static descriptions of applications and services available for deployment.

By default that would be the public Docker hub, but it could also be a private repo.\n\n Other deployables\n\nRunning \"other\" artifacts such as zips or jars heavily depends on the underlying container manager.\nWhen Vamp is set up to run with Marathon (mesosphere.github.io - Marathon), command (or cmd) deployable types can be used.\nIn that case cmd (Marathon REST API - post v2/apps) parameter will have value of deployable.\n\nExample breed - run a custom jar after it has been downloaded \nCombining this definition and the Vamp Marathon dialect  uris parameter allows the requested jar to be downloaded from a remote location (Marathon REST API - uris Array of Strings). \n\n,name: location\nclusters:\n  api:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: location\n        deployable: \n          type: cmd\n          definition: java -jar location.jar\n      marathon:\n        uris: [\"https://myrepolocation_jar\"]\n\n JavaScript deployables \n\nBreeds can have type application/javascript and definition should be a JavaScript script:\n\n,name: hello-world\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    console.log('Hello World Vamp!');\n\nIt is possible to create or update breeds with the API request POST|PUT /api/v1/breeds/ , Javascript script as body and header Content-Type: application/javascript.\n\nPorts\n\nThe ports property is an array of named ports together with their protocol. It describes on what ports the deployables is offering services to the outside world. Let's look at the following breed:\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http\n  admin: 8081/http\n  redis: 9023/tcp   \n\nPorts come in two flavors:\n\n/http HTTP ports are the default type if none is specified. They are always recommended when dealing with HTTP-based services. Vamp can record a lot of interesting metrics like response times, errors etc. Of course, using /tcp will work but you miss out on cool data.\n/tcp Use TCP ports for things like Redis, MySQL etc.\n\n  \n/http notation for ports is required for use of filters.\n  \n\nNotice we can give the ports sensible names. This specific deployable has web port for customer traffic, an admin port for admin access and a redis port for some caching probably. These names come in handy when we later compose different breeds in blueprints.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp blueprints\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":196},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/conditions","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Conditions","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 70","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nConditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.\nRead more about gateway usage. You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the /conditions endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. \n\nExample - simple inline condition\n\nThis would be used directly inside a blueprint.\n\n,condition_strength: 10%   Amount of traffic for this service in percents.\ncondition: User-Agent = IOS\n\nCreate a condition \n\nCreating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the condition field of a condition.\n\nHowever, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:\n\n| description           | syntax                       | example                  |\n| ----------------------|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| match user agent      | user-agent == value          | user-agent == Firefox    |\n| mismatch user agent   | user-agent != value          | user-agent != Firefox    |\n| match host            | host == value                | host == localhost        |\n| mismatch host         | host != value                | host != localhost       |\n| has cookie            | has cookie value             | has cookie vamp          |\n| misses cookie         | misses cookie value          | misses cookie vamp       |\n| has header            | has header value             | has header ETag          |\n| misses header         | misses header value          | misses header ETag       |\n| match cookie value    | cookie name has value    | cookie vamp has 12345    |\n| mismatch cookie value | cookie name misses value | cookie vamp misses 12345 |\n| header has value      | header name has value   | header vamp has 12345    |\n| header misses value   | header name misses value | header vamp misses 12345 |\n\nAdditional syntax examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - ConditionDefinitionParserSpec.scala.\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nIn order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between  :\n\ncondition: \" hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome \"\n\nHaving multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header\n\"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff\n\n Boolean expression in conditions\n\nVamp supports AND, OR, negation NOT and grouping ( ):\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp\n\nAdditional boolean expression examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - BooleanParserSpec.scala.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp events\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":197},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/deployments","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deployments","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nA deployment is a \"running\" blueprint. Over time, new blueprints can be merged with existing deployments or parts of the running blueprint can be removed from it. Each deployment can be exported as a blueprint and \ncopy / pasted to another environment, or even to the same environment to function as a clone.\n\nCreate a deployment\n\nYou can create a deployment in the following ways:\n\nSend a POST request to the /deployments endpoint.\nUse the UI to deploy a blueprint using the \"deploy\" button on the \"blueprints\" tab.\nUse the CLI vamp deploy command  \n $ vamp deploy my_blueprint.\n\nThe name of the deployment will be automatically assigned as a UUID (e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000).\n\n Vamp deployment process\n\nOnce we have issued the deployment, Vamp will do the following:\n\nUpdate Vamps internal model.\nIssue and monitor deployment commands to the container platform.\nUpdate the ZooKeeper entry.\nStart collecting metrics.\nMonitor the container platform for changes.\n\nVamp will add runtime information to the deployment model, like start times, resolved ports etc.\n\nDeployment scenarios\n\nA common Vamp deployment scenario is to introduce a new version of the service to an existing cluster, this is what we call a merge. After testing/migration is done, the old or new version can be removed from the cluster, simply called a removal. Let's look at each in turn.\n\n Merge\n\nMerging of new services is performed as a deployment update. You can merge in many ways:\n\nSend a PUT request to the /deployments/  endpoint.\nUse the UI to update a deployment using the \"Edit deployment\" button. \nUse the CLI with a combination of the vamp merge and vamp deploy commands.\n\nIf a service already exists then only the gateways and scale will be updated. Otherwise a new service will be added. If a new cluster doesn't exist in the deployment, it will be added.\n\nLet's deploy a simple service:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    # Specifying only a reference to the breed.\n    breed: monarch_1.0   \n\nAfter this point we may have another version ready for deployment and now instead of only one service, we have added another one:\n\n,name: monarch_1.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  # Some variable needed for our new recommendation engine,\n  # just as an example.\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    # Just a reference and this breed has one dependency:\n    # recommendation_1.0\n    breed: monarch_1.1\n\n  recommendation:\n    breed: recommendation_1.0\n \n\nNow our deployment (in simplified blueprint format) looks like this:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 0%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    \n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nNote that the route weight for monarch_1.1 is 0, i.e. no traffic is sent to it.\nLet's redirect some traffic to our new monarch_1.1 (e.g. 10%):\n\n,clusters:\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 90%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 10%\n\nNote that we can omit other fields like name, parameters and even other clusters (e.g. recommendation) if the change is not relevant to them. In this example we just wanted to update the weights.\n\nIn the last few examples we have shown the following:\n\nA fresh new deployment.\nA canary release with a cluster update and change of the topology (a new cluster was added).\nAn update of the gateways for a cluster - similar to a cluster scale update (instances, cpu, memory).\n\nRemoval\n\nRemoval is done using the REST API DELETE request together with the new blueprint as request body.\nIf a service exists it will be removed, otherwise the request is ignored. If a cluster has no more services left the cluster will be removed completely. Lastly, if a deployment has no more clusters it will be completely removed (destroyed).\n\nLet's use the example from the previous section. Notice the weight is evenly distributed (50/50). \n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 50%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 50%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100\n\nIf we are happy with the new monarch version 1.1, we can proceed with the removal of the old version.\nThis change is applied on the running deployment. We send the following YAML as the body of the DELETE request\nto the /deployments/deployment_UUID endpoint.\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    breed: monarch_1.0\n\nNote that this is the same original blueprint we started with. What we are doing here is basically \"subtracting\" one blueprint from the other, although \"the other\" is a running deployment.\nAfter this operation our deployment is:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 100%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nIn a nutshell: If we say that the first version was A and the second B, then we just did the migration from A to B without downtime:\nA** - A + B - A + B - A - **B\n\nWe could also remove the newer version (monarch_1.1 with/without recommendation cluster) in case that it didn't perform as we expected.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp environment variables\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":198},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/environment-variables","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Environment variables","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds and blueprints can include lists of environment variables that will be injected into the container at runtime. You set environment variables with the environment_variables keyword or its shorter version env, e.g. both examples below are equivalent.\n\n,environment_variables:\n  PORT: 8080\n\n,env:\n  PORT: 8080\n\nDependencies\n\nBreeds can also have dependencies on other breeds. These dependencies should be stated explicitly, similar to how you would do in a Maven pom.xml, a Ruby Gemfile or similar package dependency systems, i.e:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.1\n\nIn a lot of cases, dependencies coexist with interpolated environment variables or constants because exact values are not known untill deploy time.\n\n 'Hard' setting a variable\n\nYou want to \"hard set\" an environment variable, just like doing an export MYVAR=somevalue in a shell. This  variable could be some external dependency you have no direct control over: the endpoint of some service you use that is out of your control. It can also be some setting you want to tweak, like JVMHEAPSIZE or AWS_REGION.\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'     \n\nIt is also possible to use wildcard * at the end of the name:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.*\n\nThis will match any breed name that starts with redis:1.\n\nUsing place holders\n\nUse the ~ character to define a place holder for a variable that should be filled in at runtime (i.e. when this breed actually gets deployed), but for which you do not yet know the actual value. \n\n  \nWhen different roles in a company work on the same project. Developers can create place holders for variables that operations should fill in: it helps with separating responsibilities.\n  \n\n Example - ORACLE_PASSWORD designated as a place holder\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1' \n  ORACLE_PASSWORD: ~    \n\nResolving variables\n\nUse the $ character to reference other statements in a breed/blueprint. This allows you to dynamically resolve ports and hosts names that we don't know until a deployment is done. You can also resolve to hard coded and published constants from some other part of the blueprint or breed, typically a dependency.\n\n  \nThe $ value is escaped by $$. A more strict notation is $ \n  \n\n Vamp host variable\n\nVamp provides just one magic* variable: the host. This resolves to the host or ip address of the referenced service. Strictly speaking, the host reference resolves to the gateway agent endpoint, but users do not need to concern themselves with this. Users can think of one-on-one connections where Vamp actually does server-side service discovery to decouple services.\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host         resolves to a host at runtime\n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port  # resolves to a port at runtime\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency's environment variables\nWhat if the backend is configured through some environment variable, but the frontend also needs that information? For example, the encoding type for our database. We can just reference that environment variable using the exact same syntax.\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n      BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n    environment_variables:\n      ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'    injected into the backend MySQL container\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants (see below) allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\nEnvironment variable scope\n\nEnvironment variables can live on different scopes and can be overridden by scopes higher in the scope hierarchy.\nA scope is an area of your breed or blueprint definition that limits the visibility of variables and references inside that scope.\n\nBreed scope: The scope used in all the above examples is the default scope. If you never define any environment_variables in any other place, this will be used.\n\nCluster scope: Will override the breed scope and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override environment variables for all services that belong to a cluster.\n\nService scope: Will override breed scope and cluster scope, and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override all environment variables for a specific service within a cluster.\n\n   \nEffective use of scope is completely dependent on your use case. The various scopes help to separate concerns when multiple people and/or teams work on Vamp artifacts and deployments and need to decouple their effort.\n  \n\n Examples of scope use\n\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\nOverride the JVMHEAPSIZE in production\nUse a place holder\nJust for fun - combine all scopes and references\n\nExample 1\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\n\nUse case: As a devOps-er you want to test one service configured in two different ways at the same time. Your service is configurable using environment variables. In this case we are testing a connection pool setting. \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we just use the breed level environment variables. The traffic is split into a 50/50 divide between both services.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-a\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 30                \n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-b               different breed name, same deployable\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 60                 # different pool size\n\n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nExample 2\nOverride the JVM_HEAP_SIZE in production\n\nUse case: As a developer, you created your service with a default heap size you use on your development laptop and maybe on a test environment. Once your service goes \"live\", an ops guy/gal should be able to override this setting.\n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we override the variable JVMHEAPSIZE for the whole frontend cluster by specifically marking it with .dot-notation cluster.variable \n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                   cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2800          # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200         # will be overridden by deployment level: 2800\n\nExample 3\nUse a place holder\n\nUse case: As a developer, you might not know some value your service needs at runtime, say the Google Anaytics ID your company uses. However, your Node.js frontend needs it! \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint the ~ place holder is used to explicitly demand that a variable is set by a higher scope. When this variable is NOT provided, Vamp will report an error at deploy time.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: 'UA-53758816-1'  # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/node_express:1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: ~               # If not provided at higher scope, \n                                                  # Vamp reports error.\n\nExample 4\nCombine all scopes and references\n\nAs a final example, let's combine some of the examples above and include referenced breeds. In this case, we have two breed artifacts already stored in Vamp and include them by using the ref keyword.\n\nIn the below blueprint:  \n\nwe override all breed scope JVMHEAPSIZE variables with cluster scope environment_variables\nto further tweak the JVMHEAPSIZE for the service frontendapp:1.0-b, we also add service scope environmentvariables for that service.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2400                    # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-a\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-b        \n        environment_variables:           \n          JVMHEAPSIZE: 1800               # overrides the breed level AND cluster level\n          \n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nConstants\n\nSometimes you just want configuration information to be available in a breed or blueprint. You don't need that information to be directly exposed as an environment variable. As a convenience, Vamp allows you to set constants.\nThese are values that cannot be changed during deploy time.\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\n Exammple - using constants\n\n,clusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n        MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n        BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n        SCHEMA: $backend.constants.SCHEMA_NAME\n      dependencies:\n        backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed:\n      name: mysql:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'\n      constants:\n        SCHEMA_NAME: 'customers'    # NOT injected into the backend MySQL container\n\n  \nRead about Vamp gateways\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":199},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/escalations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 100","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nAn escalation is a workflow triggered by an escalation event.

If the events match the escalation handlers defined in the DSL, the action is executed.\n\nAgain: escalation events can be generated by third party systems and they will be handled in the same manner as events created by Vamp SLA workflows. \n\nEscalation handlers\n\nAny escalation that is triggered should be handled by an escalation handler\n\nVamp ships with the following set of escalation handlers - scaleinstances, scalecpu and scale_memory. These handlers can be composed into intricate escalation systems.\n\n scale_instances   \nScales up the number of running instances. It is applied only to the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). You can set upper limits to how far you want to scale out or in, effectively guaranteeing a minimum set of running instances. This is very much like AWS auto-scaling.  \nExample - scale_instances\n,type: scale_instances\ntarget: monarch   Target cluster for the scale up/down.\n                 # If it's not specified, by default it's the \n                 # current cluster where SLA escalations are \n                 # specified.\nminimum: 1       # Minimum number of instances.\nmaximum: 3       # Maximum number of instances.\nscale_by: 1      # Increment/decrement to use on current \n                 # number of running instances.\nscale_cpu \nScales up the number of CPUs per instances. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_cpu\n,type: scale_cpu\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 1\nmaximum: 3 \nscale_by: 0.5\nscale_memory   \nScales up the memory per instance. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_memory  \n,type: scale_memory\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 512     # In MB.\nmaximum: 4096    # In MB.\nscale_by: 512    # In MB.\n\nComposing escalation handlers\n\nVamp has a set of predefined escalation handler types that deal with escalations. You can compose these handlers in the DSL to get the desired outcome of an escalation event. The escalation handlers toall and toone are supported:\n\n to_all  \nThis is a \"group\" escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to all escalation handlers from its list. No order or hierarchy.    \n\nExample - to_all  \n,to_all:\n  escalations:\n     Scale up/down.\n    scale_instances\n    # And notify for each event.\n    notify\nto_one  \nThis is a group escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to each escalation handler (from its list) until one can handle it. On an Escalate event, it will start at the head of the list. During a DeEscalate event is will start at the rear.  \nWhen is this useful? Well, Vamp could try to scale up the service and if that;s not possible anymore (e.g. reached the upper limit of allowed scale) then an email can be sent.  \n\n Example - simple use of to_one\n,to_one:\n  escalations:\n    # First try to escalate.\n    scale_instances\n    # If it's not possible, proceed with notifying.\n    notify\nExample - complex use of to_one  \n,name: monarch\n\ngateways:\n  80: monarch1/port\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  monarch2.password: secret\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch1:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch1\n      deployable: vamp/monarch1\n      ports:\n        port: 80/http\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_HOST: $storage.host\n        DB_PORT: $storage.ports.port\n        STORAGEPASS: $storage.environmentvariables.password\n      \n      dependencies:\n        storage: monarch2\n\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n    \n    sla:\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000\n        lower: 100\n      window:\n        interval: 600\n        cooldown: 600\n      escalations:\n        to_one:\n            escalations:\n              type: scale_instances\n                 First try to scale up storage service.\n                target: monarch2\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              type: scale_instances\n                # If we cannot scale up storage anymore, scale up this.\n                target: monarch1\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              \n  monarch2:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch2\n      deployable: vamp/monarch2\n      ports:\n        port: 3306\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_PASS: password\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n\n  \nRead about Referencing artifacts in Vamp\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":200},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/events","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions.\n\nAll events are stored and retrieved using the Event API that is part of Vamp.\n\nExample - JSON \"deployment create\" event\n\n \n\n Basic event rules\n\nAll events stick to some basic rules:\n\nAll data in Vamp are events. \nValues can be any JSON object or it can be empty.\nTimestamps are in ISO8601/RFC3339.\nTimestamps are optional. If not provided, Vamp will insert the current time.\nTimestamps are inclusive for querying.\nEvents can be tagged with metadata. A simple tag is just single string.\nQuerying data by tag assumes \"AND\" behaviour when multiple tags are supplied, i.e. [\"one\", \"two\"] would only fetch records that are tagged with both.\nSupported event aggregations are: average, min, max and count.\n\nHow tags are organised\n\nIn all of Vamp's components we follow a REST (resource oriented) schema, for instance:\n/deployments/  \n/deployments/ /clusters/ /services/ \nTagging is done using a very similar schema: \" \", \" : \". For example:\n\n[\n    \"deployments\", \n    \"deployments: \", \n    \"clusters\", \n    \"clusters: \", \n    \"services\", \n    \"services: \"\n]\n\nThis schema allows querying per group and per specific name. Getting all events related to all deployments is done by using tag \"deployments\". Getting events for specific deployment \"deployments: \".\n\n Query events using tags\n\nUsing the tags schema and timestamps, you can do some powerful queries. Either use an exact timestamp or use special range query operators, described on the elastic.co site (elastic.co - Range query).\n\n  \nthe default page size for a set of returned events is 30.\n  \n\nExample queries\n\nGet all events\nResponse time for a cluster\nCurrent sessions for a service\nll known events for a service\n \n Example 1\nGet all events\n\nThe below query gets ALL metrics events up till now, taking into regard the pagination.\n\n  \nGET request with body - similar to approach used by Elasticsearch.\n  \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 2 \nResponse time for a cluster\n\nThe below query gets the most recent response time events for the \"frontend\" cluster in the \"d9b42796-d8f6-431b-9230-9d316defaf6d\" deployment.\n\nNotice the \"gateways:UUID\", \"metrics:responseTime\" and \"gateways\" tags. This means \"give me the response time of this specific gateway at the gateway level\". The response will echo back the events in the time range with the original set of tags associated with the events. \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n[\n     ,\n     \n]    \n\n Example 3\nCurrent sessions for a service\n\nAnother example is getting the current sessions for a specific service, in this case the monarch_front:0.2 service that is part of the 214615ec-d5e4-473e-a98e-8aa4998b16f4 deployment and lives in the frontend cluster.\n\nNotice we made the search more specific by specifying the \"services\" and then \"service:SERVICE NAME\" tag.\nAlso, we are using relative timestamps: anything later or equal (lte) than \"now\".\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 4\nAll known events for a service\n\nThis below query gives you all the events we have for a specific service, in this case the same service as in example 2. In this way you can get a quick \"health snapshot\" of service, server, cluster or deployment.\n\nNotice we made the search less specific by just providing the \"metrics\" tag and not telling the API which specific one we want.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n Server-sent events (SSE)\n\nEvents can be streamed back directly from Vamp.\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream\n\nIn order to narrow down (filter) events, list of tags could be provided in the request body.\n\n \n\nGET method can be also used with tag parameter (may be more convenient):\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream?tag=archiving&tag=breeds\n\nArchiving\n\nAll changes in artifacts (creation, update or deletion) triggered by REST API calls are archived. We store the type of event and the original representation of the artifact. It's a bit like a Git log. \n\nHere is an example event:\n\n \n\nSearching through the archive is 100% the same as searching for events. The same tagging scheme applies.\nThe following query gives back the last set of delete actions executed in the Vamp API, regardless of the artifact type.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n  \nRead about Vamp SLA (Service Level Agreement)\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":201},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/gateways","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Gateways","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nGateways are dynmic runtime entities in the Vamp eco-system. They represent load balancer rules to deployment, cluster and service instances. There are two types of gateways:\n\nInternal gateways are created automatically for each deployment cluster and updated using the gateway/deployment API\nExternal gateways are explicitly declared either in a deployment blueprint or using the gateway API\n\nExample - automatically created gateway \n\nThe below gateway is for deployment vamp, cluster sava and port port.  \nThe cluster contains two services sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0, each with two running instances. \n,name: vamp/sava/port            name\nport: 40000/http               # port, either http or tcp, assigned by Vamp\nactive: true                   # is it running - not in case of non (yet) existing routes\nsticky: none\nroutes:                        # routes\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.0.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda3c376-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31463\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda2d915-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31292\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.1.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa3c9e4-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31634\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa37bc3-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31826\n\nGateway Usage\n\nThe gateway API allows for programmable routing. External gateways give an entry point to clusters (optionally specified in deployment blueprints), and allow for canary releasing and A/B testing across deployments.\n\nA gateway defines a set of rules for routing traffic between different services within the same cluster.\nVamp allows you to determine this in three ways:\n\nA condition will target specific traffic. Read more about conditions  \nfor example, IOS users\nThe condition_strength targets a percentage of traffic matching a condition  \nfor example, 10% of IOS users\nThe weight for each available route (%) defines the distribution of all remaining traffic (not matching or not targetted by a condition)  \nfor example, 100% of all traffic, except the targetted 10% of IOS users\n\n Routes, condition-strength and weights\n\nEach route can have a weight and one or more conditions (see boolean expression in conditions). Each condition has a condition-strength.\n\nRouting is calculated as followed:\n\nFind the first condition that matches the request. Read more about conditions  \nfor example, IOS users\nIf the route exists, send the request to it depending on the condition strength  \nfor example, 10% of IOS users are sent to the route\nIf, based on condition strength, the request should not follow that route, then send request to one from all routes based on their weight.  \nfor example, all non-IOS traffic and 90% of IOS users are routed according to route weight\n\n  \nVamp has to account for all traffic.  \nWhen defining weights, the total weight of all routes must always add up to 100%.\nThis means that in a straight three-way split one service must be given 34% as 33%+33%+33%=99%.  1% can be a lot of traffic in high volume environments.\n  \n\nExample - Route all Firefox and only Firefox users to route service_B:\n\nservice_A:\n  weight: 100%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 0%\n  condition_strength: 100%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\n Example - Route half of Firefox users to serviceB, other half to serviceA (80%) or service_B (20%):\nNon Firefox requests will be just sent to serviceA (80%) or serviceB (20%).\nservice_A:\n  weight: 80%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 20%\n  condition_strength: 50%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\nExample - A/B test two deployments using route weight\nBelow is a basic example, similar to putting both deployments (sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0) in the same cluster.  \nIt is easy to imagine having an older legacy application and the new one and doing a full canary release (or A/B testing) in seamless way by using gateways like this.\n\nDeployment 1: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.0\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.0.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nDeployment 2: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.1\n\n,name: sava:1.1\ngateways:\n  9060/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.1.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nGateway (90% / 10%): POST /api/v1/gateways\n\n,name: sava\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  sava:1.0/sava/port:\n    weight: 90%           condition can be used as well\n  sava:1.1/sava/port:\n    weight: 10%\n\nURL path rewrite\n\nVamp supports URL path rewrite. This can be a powerful solution in defining service APIs (e.g. RESTful) outside of application service.  Path rewrite is defined in the format path: NEW_PATH if CONDITION, where:\n\nNEW_PATH new path to be used; HAProxy variables are supported, e.g. %[path]\nCONDITION condition using HAProxy directives, e.g. matching path, method, headers etc.\n\n Example\nroutes:\n  web/port1:\n    rewrites:\n    path: a if b\n  web/port2:\n    weight: 100%\n\nVamp managed and external routes\n\nVamp managed routes are in the format:\n\ngateway - pointing to another gateway, e.g. it is possible to chain gateways\ndeployment/cluster - pointing to deployment cluster, i.e. services are not 'visible'\ndeployment/cluster/service - pointing to specific service within deployment cluster\n\nAll examples above cover only Vamp managed routes.\nIt is also possible to route traffic to specific IP or hostname and port.\nIn that case IP or hostname and port need to be specified between brackets, e.g. [hostname:port] (and double quotes due to Yaml syntax).\n\nname: mesos\nport: 8080/http\nsticky: route\n\nroutes:\n  \"[192.168.99.100:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n  \"[localhost:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n\n  \nRead about Vamp conditions\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":202},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/references","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Referencing artifacts","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 110","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nWith any artifact, Vamp allows you to either use an inline notation or reference the artifact by name. For references, you use the reference keyword or its shorter version ref. Think of it like either using actual values or pointers to a value. This has a big impact on how complex or simple you can make any blueprint, breed or deployment. It also impacts how much knowledge you need to have of all the different artifacts that are used in a typical deployment or blueprint.\n\nVamp assumes that referenced artifcats (the breed called my_breed in the example below) is available to load from its datastore at deploy time. This goes for all basic artifacts in Vamp: SLA's, gateways, conditions, escalations, etc.\n\nExample - reference notation\n\ninline notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          name: my_breed\n          deployable: registry.example.com/app:1.0\n        scale:\n          cpu: 2\n          memory: 1024MB\n          instances: 4\nreference notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          reference: my_breed\n        scale:\n          reference: medium  \n\n Working with references\n\nWhen you begin to work with Vamp, you will probably start with inline artifacts. You have everything in one place and can directly see what properties each artifact has. Later, you can start specialising and basically build a library of often used architectural components. \n\nExample use of references\n\nCreate a library of containers\nFix scales per environment\nReuse a complex condition\n\n Example 1 \nCreate a library of containers\n\nUse case: You have a Redis container you have tweaked and setup exactly the way you want it. You want to use that exact container in all your environments (dev, test, prod etc.). \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a breed and use either the Vamp UI or API to save it (below). Now you can just use the ref: redis:1.0 notation anywhere in a blueprint.\n\nPOST /api/v1/breeds\n\n,name: redis:1.0\ndeployable: redis\nports: 6379/tcp\n\nExample 2\nFix scales per environment\n\nUse case: You want to have a predetermined set of scales you can use per deployment per environment. For instance, a \"mediumproduction\" should be something else than a \"mediumtest\".\n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a scale and use either the Vamp API to save it (below). Now you can use the ref: mediumtest or ref: mediumprod notation anywhere a scale type is required.\n\nPOST /api/v1/scales\n\n,name: medium_prod\ncpu: 2\nmemory: 4096MB\ninstances: 3\n\n,name: medium_test\ncpu: 0.5\nmemory: 1024MB\ninstances: 1\n\n Example 3\nReuse a complex condition\n\nUse case: You have created a complex condition to target a specific part of your traffic. In this case users with a cookie that have a specific session variable set in that cookie. You want to use that condition now and then to do some testing. \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a condition and use either the Vamp API to save it (below). Now you can use the  ref: conditionemptyshopping_cart anywhere that condition is required.\n\n,name: conditionemptyshopping_cart\ncondition: Cookie SHOPSESSION Contains shoppingbasketitems=0 \n\n  \nRead about Vamp workflows\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":203},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"service-discovery-2\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 135","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery). In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry (microservices.io - service registry).\n\nFor Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:\n\nNo code injection needed.\nNo extra libraries or agents needed.\nplatform/language agnostic: it’s just HTTP.\nEasy integration using ENV variables.\n\nCreate and publish a service\n\n  \nServices do not register themselves. They are explicitly created, registered in the Vamp database and provisioned on the load balancer.\n  \n\nServices are created and published as follows:\n\nThe user describes a service and its desired endpoint port in the Vamp DSL.\nThe service is deployed to the configured container manager by Vamp.\nVamp instructs Vamp Gateway Agent (via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul) to set up service endpoints.\nVamp Gateway Agent takes care of configuring HAProxy, making the services available.\n\nAfter this, you can scale the service up/down or in/out either by hand or using Vamp’s auto scaling functionality. The endpoint is stable.\n\n Discovering a service\n\nSo, how does one service find a dependent service? Services are found by just referencing them in the DSL. Take a look at the following example:\n,name: my_blueprint:1.0\nclusters:\n  myfrontendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: myfrontendservice:0.1\n        deployable: company/frontend:0.1\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        dependencies:\n          backend: mybackendservice:0.3\n        environment_variables:\n         BACKEND_HOST: $backend.host\n         BACKEND_PORT: $backend.ports.jdbc\n      scale:\n        instances: 3         \n  mybackendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: mybackendservice:0.3\n        deployable: company/backend:0.3\n        ports:\n          jdbc: 8080/tcp\n      scale:\n        instances: 4\n\nWe have a frontend cluster and a backend cluster. These are just organisational units.\nThe frontend cluster runs just one version of our service, consisting of three instances.\nThe frontend service has a hard dependency on a backend (tcp) service.\nWe reference the backend by name, my_backend:0.3, and assign it a label, in this case just backend\nWe use the label backend to get the host and a specific port (jdbc) from this backend.\nWe assign these values to environment variables that are exposed in the container runtime.\nAny frontend service now has access to the location of the dependent backend service.\n\nNote that there is no point-to-point wiring. The $backend.host and $backend.ports.jdbc variables resolve to service endpoints Vamp automatically sets up and exposes.\n\nEven though Vamp provides this type of service discovery, it does not put any constraint on other possible solutions. For instance services can use their own approach specific approach using service registry, self-registration etc.\n\nConfigure the gateway-driver\n\nThe gateway-driver section of the Vamp configuration file application.conf configures how traffic should be routed through Vamp Gateway Agent. See the below example on how to configure this:\n\nvamp  \n     \n   \n   \n\nThe reason for the need to configure vamp.gateway-driver.host is that when services are deployed, they need to be able to find Vamp Gateway Agent in their respective networks. This can be a totally different network than where Vamp is running.\nLet's use an example: frontend and backend service, frontend depends on backend - in Vamp DSL that would be 2 clusters (assuming the same deployment).\nThere are different ways how frontend can discover its dependency backend, and to make things simpler Vamp supports using specific environment parameters.\n\n,name: my-web-app\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-frontend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-frontend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.port\n        dependencies:\n          backend: my-backend:1.0.0\n  backend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-backend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-backend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n\nIn this example $backend.host will have the value of the vamp.gateway-driver.host configuration parameter, while $backend.ports.port the next available port from vamp.operation.gateway.port-range.\nfrontend doesn't connect to backend directly but via Vamp Gateway Agent(s) - given on these host and port parameters.\nThis is quite simmilar to common pattern to access any clustered application.\nFor instance if you want to access DB server, you will have an address string based on e.g. DNS name or something simmilar.\nNote that even without Vamp, you would need to setup access to backend in some similar way.\nWith Vamp, access is via VGA's and that allows specific routing (conditions, weights) needed for A/B testing and canary releasing.\n\n  \nRead about using Vamp with virtual hosts\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":204},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.1/sla","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"SLA (Service Level Agreement)","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 90","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nSLA stands for \"Service Level Agreement\". Vamp uses it to define a pre-described set of boundaries to a service and the actions that should take place once the service crosses those boundaries. In essence, an SLA and its associated escalation is a workflow that is checked and controlled by Vamp based on the runtime behaviour of a service. SLAs and escalations are defined with the VAMP DSL.\n\nThe SLA event system\n\nYou can define an SLA for each cluster in a blueprint. A common example would be to check if the average response time of the cluster (averaged across all services) is higher or lower than a certain threshold. Under the hood, an SLA workflow creates two distinct events. These are are sent from Vamp and stored to Elasticsearch.\n\nEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is higher than the upper threshold.\nDeEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is lower than the lower threshold.\n\nSLA monitoring is a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. On each run an SLA workflow is executed for each deployment & cluster that has an SLA defined. Within the same SLA definition it's possible to define a list of escalations. Escalations are triggered by escalation events (Escalate/DeEscalate).\n\nThis means escalation events can be generated by the third party systems by sending them to Elasticsearch. This would allow scaling up or down to be triggered by basically any system that can POST a piece of JSON.\n\nSLA's are in essence pieces of code inside Vamp that stick to this event model and can use, if they want, the metrics and event data streaming out of Elasticsearch to make decisions on how things are and should be running.\n\n SLA types\n\nVamp currently ships with the following SLA types:\n\nresponsetimesliding_window\n\nResponse time with sliding window \n\nThe responsetimesliding_window SLA triggers events based on response times. \n\n Example - SLA defined inline in a blueprint.\n\nNotice the SLA is defined per cluster and acts on the first service in the cluster.\n\nNotice how the SLA is defined separately from the escalations. This is key to how Vamp approaches SLA's and how modular and extendable the system is.\n\n,name: sava\n\ngateways:\n  80: sava/webport\n\nclusters:\n\n  sava:                        # the sava cluster\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: monarch\n        deployable: vamp/monarch\n        ports:\n          webport: 80\n\n      scale:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1024MB\n        instances: 2\n\n    sla:                        # SLA applies to the first service in the sava cluster (monarch)\n      # Type of SLA.\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000   # Upper threshold in milliseconds.\n        lower: 100    # Lower threshold in milliseconds.\n      window:\n        interval: 600 # Time period in seconds used for\n                      # average response time aggregation.\n        cooldown: 600 # Time period in seconds.

This means you reference your breeds (or define them inline) and add runtime configuration to them.\n\nBlueprints allow you to add the following extra properties:\n\nGateways: a stable port where the service can be reached.\nClusters and services: a cluster is a grouping of services with one purpose, i.e. two versions (a/b) of one service.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nDialects: a dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform, i.e. Docker or Mesosphere Marathon.\nScale: the CPU and memory and the amount of instance allocate to a service.\nConditions: how traffic should be directed based on HTTP and/or TCP properties.\nSLA and escalations: SLA definition that controls autoscaling.\n\nExample - key concepts of blueprints\n\n,name: my_blueprint                         Custom blueprint name\ngateways:\n  8080/http: my_frontend/port\nclusters:\n  my_frontend:                            # Custom cluster name.\n  \n    gateways:                             # Gateway for this cluster services.\n      routes:                             # Makes sense only with\n        somecoolbreed:                  # multiple services per cluster.\n          weight: 95%\n          condition: User-Agent = Chrome\n        someotherbreed:                 # Second service.\n          weight: 5%\n          \n    services:                             # List of services\n      breed:\n          ref: somecoolbreed\n        scale:                            # Scale for this service.\n          cpu: 2                          # Number of CPUs per instance.\n          memory: 2048MB                  # Memory per instance (MB/GB units).\n          instances: 2                    # Number of instances\n      breed: \n          ref: someotherbreed           # Another service in the same cluster.  \n        scale: large                      # Notice we used a reference to a \"scale\". \n                                          # More on this later.\n\nGateways\n\nA gateway is a \"stable\" endpoint (or port in simplified sense) that almost never changes. When creating the mapping, it uses the definition (my_frontend/port in this case) from the \"first\" service in the cluster definition you reference. This service can of course be changed, but the gateway port normally doesn't.\n\nPlease take care of setting the /tcp or /http (default) type for the port. Using /http allows Vamp to record more relevant metrics like response times and metrics.\n\nRead more about gateways.\n\n  \ngateways are optional. You can just deploy services and have a home grown method to connect them to some stable, exposable endpoint.\n  \n\n Clusters and services\n\nIn essence, blueprints define a collection of clusters.\nA cluster is a group of different services, which will appear as a single service and serve a single purpose.\n\nCommon use cases would be service A and B in an A/B testing scenario - usually just different\nversions of the same service (e.g. canary release or blue/green deployment).\n\nClusters are configured by defining an array of services. A cluster can be given an arbitrary name. Services are just lists or arrays of breeds.\n\n,mycoolcluster\n  services\n   breed: \n      ref: mycoolservice_A      # reference to an existing breed\n   breed:                       # shortened inline breed\n       name: mycoolservice_B\n       deployable: some_container\n       ...\n\nClusters and services are just organisational items. Vamp uses them to order, reference and control the actual containers and gateways and traffic.\n\n This all seems redundant, right? We have a reference chain of blueprints - gateways - clusters - services - breeds - deployable. However, you need this level of control and granularity in any serious environment where DRY principles are taken seriously and where \"one size fits all\" doesn't fly.\n\nDialects\n\nVamp allows you to use container driver specific tags inside blueprints. We call this a “dialect”.  Dialects effectively enable you to make full use of, for instance, the underlying features like mounting disks, settings commands and providing access to private Docker registries.\n\nWe currently support the following dialects:\n\ndocker:\nmarathon:\n\n Docker dialect\n\nThe following example show how you can mount a volume to a Docker container using the Docker dialect.\n\nExample blueprint - using the Docker dialect\n\n,name: busybox\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox-breed\n        deployable: busybox:latest\n      docker:\n        Volumes:\n          \"/tmp\": ~\n\nVamp will translate this into the proper API call. Inspecting the container after it's deployed should show something similar to this:\n\n...\n\"Volumes\":  ,\n...    \n\n Marathon dialect\n\nThis is an example with Marathon that pulls an image from private repo, mounts some volumes, sets some labels and gets run with an ad hoc command: all taken care of by Marathon.\n  \nWe can provide the marathon: tag either on the service level, or the cluster level. Any marathon: tag set on the service level will override the cluster level as it is more specific. However, in 9 out of 10 cases the cluster level makes the most sense. Later, you can also mix dialects so you can prep your blueprint for multiple environments and run times within one description.\n\nexample blueprint - using the Marathon dialect\n\nNotice the following:\n\nUnder the marathon: tag, we provide the command to run in the container by setting the cmd: tag.\nWe provide a url to some credentials file in the uri array. As described in the Marathon docs (mesosphere.github.io/marathon - using a private Docker repository) this enables Mesos\nto pull from a private registry, in this case registry.example.com where these credentials are set up.\nWe set some labels with some arbitrary metadata.\nWe mount the /tmp to in Read/Write mode.\n\n,name: busy-top:1.0\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox\n        deployable: registry.example.com/busybox:latest\n      marathon:\n       cmd: \"top\"\n       uris:\n         \"https://somehost/somepath/somefilewithdockercredentials\"\n       labels:\n         environment: \"staging\"\n         owner: \"buffy the vamp slayer\"\n       container:\n         volumes:\n           containerPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             hostPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             mode: \"RW\"\n\n Scale\n\nScale is the \"size\" of a deployed service. Usually that means the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory.\n\nScales can be defined inline in a blueprint or they can defined separately and given a unique name. The following example is a scale named \"small\". POST-ing this scale to the /scales REST API endpoint will store it under that name so it can be referenced from other blueprints.\n\nExample scale\n\n,name: small    Custom name.\n\ncpu: 2        # Number of CPUs per instance.\nmemory: 2gb   # Memory per instance, MB/GB units.\ninstances: 2  # Number of instances.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp deployments\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":210},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/breeds","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Breeds","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"breeds-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds are static descriptions of applications and services available for deployment. Each breed is described by the DSL in YAML notation or JSON, whatever you like. This description includes name, version, available parameters, dependencies etc.\nTo a certain degree, you could compare a breed to a Maven artifact or a Ruby Gem description.\n\nBreeds allow you to set the following properties:\n\nDeployable: the name of actual container or command that should be run.\nPorts: a map of ports your container exposes.\nDependencies: a list of other breeds this breed depends on.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\n\nDeployable\n\nDeployables are pointers to the actual artifacts that get deployed. Vamp supports Docker containers or can support any other artifacts supported by your container manager. \n\n Example breed - deploy a Docker container\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http   \n\nThis breed, with a unique name, describes a deployable and the port it works on. \n\nDocker deployables\n\nDocker images are pulled by your container manager from any of the repositories configured. By default that would be the public Docker hub, but it could also be a private repo.\nThe default deployable type is a Docker container, but we could also make this explicit by setting type to docker. The following statements are equivalent:\n\n,deployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\n,deployable: \n  type: container/docker\n  definition: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nThis shows the full (expanded) deployable with type and definition.\n\n Other deployables\n\nRunning \"other\" artifacts such as zips or jars heavily depends on the underlying container manager.\nWhen Vamp is set up to run with Marathon (mesosphere.github.io - Marathon), command (or cmd) deployable types can be used.\nIn that case cmd (Marathon REST API - post v2/apps) parameter will have value of deployable.\n\nExample breed - run a custom jar after it has been downloaded \nCombining this definition and the Vamp Marathon dialect  uris parameter allows the requested jar to be downloaded from a remote location (Marathon REST API - uris Array of Strings). \n\n,name: location\nclusters:\n  api:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: location\n        deployable: \n          type: cmd\n          definition: java -jar location.jar\n      marathon:\n        uris: [\"https://myrepolocation_jar\"]\n\n JavaScript deployables \n\nBreeds can have type application/javascript and definition should be a JavaScript script:\n\n,name: hello-world\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    console.log('Hello World Vamp!');\n\nIt is possible to create or update breeds with the API request POST|PUT /api/v1/breeds/ , Javascript script as body and header Content-Type: application/javascript.\n\nPorts\n\nThe ports property is an array of named ports together with their protocol. It describes on what ports the deployables is offering services to the outside world. Let's look at the following breed:\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http\n  admin: 8081/http\n  redis: 9023/tcp   \n\nPorts come in two flavors:\n\n/http HTTP ports are the default type if none is specified. They are always recommended when dealing with HTTP-based services. Vamp can record a lot of interesting metrics like response times, errors etc. Of course, using /tcp will work but you miss out on cool data.\n/tcp Use TCP ports for things like Redis, MySQL etc.\n\n  \n/http notation for ports is required for use of filters.\n  \n\nNotice we can give the ports sensible names. This specific deployable has web port for customer traffic, an admin port for admin access and a redis port for some caching probably. These names come in handy when we later compose different breeds in blueprints.\n\n Dependencies\n\nBreeds can also have dependencies on other breeds. These dependencies should be stated explicitly, similar to how you would do in a Maven pom.xml, a Ruby Gemfile or similar package dependency systems, i.e:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.1\n\nIt is also possible to use wildcard * at the end of the name. This will match any breed name that starts with redis:1.:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.*\n\nIn a lot of cases, dependencies coexist with interpolated environment variables or constants because exact values are not known untill deploy time.  \nRead more about environment variables\n\n  \nRead about Vamp blueprints\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":211},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/conditions","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Conditions","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"conditions-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 70","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nConditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.\nRead more about gateway usage. You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the /conditions endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. \n\nExample - simple inline condition\n\nThis would be used directly inside a blueprint.\n\n,condition_strength: 10%   Amount of traffic for this service in percents.\ncondition: User-Agent = IOS\n\nCreate a condition \n\nCreating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the condition field of a condition.\n\nHowever, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:\n\n| description           | syntax                       | example                  |\n| ----------------------|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| match user agent      | user-agent == value          | user-agent == Firefox    |\n| mismatch user agent   | user-agent != value          | user-agent != Firefox    |\n| match host            | host == value                | host == localhost        |\n| mismatch host         | host != value                | host != localhost       |\n| has cookie            | has cookie value             | has cookie vamp          |\n| misses cookie         | misses cookie value          | misses cookie vamp       |\n| has header            | has header value             | has header ETag          |\n| misses header         | misses header value          | misses header ETag       |\n| match cookie value    | cookie name has value    | cookie vamp has 12345    |\n| mismatch cookie value | cookie name misses value | cookie vamp misses 12345 |\n| header has value      | header name has value   | header vamp has 12345    |\n| header misses value   | header name misses value | header vamp misses 12345 |\n\nAdditional syntax examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - ConditionDefinitionParserSpec.scala.\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nIn order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between  :\n\ncondition: \" hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome \"\n\nHaving multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header\n\"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff\n\n Boolean expression in conditions\n\nVamp supports AND, OR, negation NOT and grouping ( ):\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp\n\nAdditional boolean expression examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - BooleanParserSpec.scala.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp events\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":212},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/deployments","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deployments","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"deployments-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nA deployment is a \"running\" blueprint. Over time, new blueprints can be merged with existing deployments or parts of the running blueprint can be removed from it. Each deployment can be exported as a blueprint and \ncopy / pasted to another environment, or even to the same environment to function as a clone.\n\nCreate a deployment\n\nYou can create a deployment in the following ways:\n\nSend a POST request to the /deployments endpoint.\nUse the UI to deploy a blueprint using the \"deploy\" button on the \"blueprints\" tab.\nUse the CLI vamp deploy command  \n $ vamp deploy my_blueprint.\n\nThe name of the deployment will be automatically assigned as a UUID (e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000).\n\n Vamp deployment process\n\nOnce we have issued the deployment, Vamp will do the following:\n\nUpdate Vamps internal model.\nIssue and monitor deployment commands to the container platform.\nUpdate the ZooKeeper entry.\nStart collecting metrics.\nMonitor the container platform for changes.\n\nVamp will add runtime information to the deployment model, like start times, resolved ports etc.\n\nDeployment scenarios\n\nA common Vamp deployment scenario is to introduce a new version of the service to an existing cluster, this is what we call a merge. After testing/migration is done, the old or new version can be removed from the cluster, simply called a removal. Let's look at each in turn.\n\n Merge\n\nMerging of new services is performed as a deployment update. You can merge in many ways:\n\nSend a PUT request to the /deployments/  endpoint.\nUse the UI to update a deployment using the \"Edit deployment\" button. \nUse the CLI with a combination of the vamp merge and vamp deploy commands.\n\nIf a service already exists then only the gateways and scale will be updated. Otherwise a new service will be added. If a new cluster doesn't exist in the deployment, it will be added.\n\nLet's deploy a simple service:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    # Specifying only a reference to the breed.\n    breed: monarch_1.0   \n\nAfter this point we may have another version ready for deployment and now instead of only one service, we have added another one:\n\n,name: monarch_1.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  # Some variable needed for our new recommendation engine,\n  # just as an example.\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    # Just a reference and this breed has one dependency:\n    # recommendation_1.0\n    breed: monarch_1.1\n\n  recommendation:\n    breed: recommendation_1.0\n \n\nNow our deployment (in simplified blueprint format) looks like this:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 0%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    \n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nNote that the route weight for monarch_1.1 is 0, i.e. no traffic is sent to it.\nLet's redirect some traffic to our new monarch_1.1 (e.g. 10%):\n\n,clusters:\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 90%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 10%\n\nNote that we can omit other fields like name, parameters and even other clusters (e.g. recommendation) if the change is not relevant to them. In this example we just wanted to update the weights.\n\nIn the last few examples we have shown the following:\n\nA fresh new deployment.\nA canary release with a cluster update and change of the topology (a new cluster was added).\nAn update of the gateways for a cluster - similar to a cluster scale update (instances, cpu, memory).\n\nRemoval\n\nRemoval is done using the REST API DELETE request together with the new blueprint as request body.\nIf a service exists it will be removed, otherwise the request is ignored. If a cluster has no more services left the cluster will be removed completely. Lastly, if a deployment has no more clusters it will be completely removed (destroyed).\n\nLet's use the example from the previous section. Notice the weight is evenly distributed (50/50). \n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 50%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 50%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100\n\nIf we are happy with the new monarch version 1.1, we can proceed with the removal of the old version.\nThis change is applied on the running deployment. We send the following YAML as the body of the DELETE request\nto the /deployments/deployment_UUID endpoint.\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    breed: monarch_1.0\n\nNote that this is the same original blueprint we started with. What we are doing here is basically \"subtracting\" one blueprint from the other, although \"the other\" is a running deployment.\nAfter this operation our deployment is:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 100%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nIn a nutshell: If we say that the first version was A and the second B, then we just did the migration from A to B without downtime:\nA** - A + B - A + B - A - **B\n\nWe could also remove the newer version (monarch_1.1 with/without recommendation cluster) in case that it didn't perform as we expected.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp environment variables\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":213},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/environment-variables","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Environment variables","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"environment-variables-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds, blueprints and workflows can include a list of environment variables to be injected into the container at runtime.

This  variable could be some external dependency you have no direct control over: the endpoint of some service you use that is out of your control. It can also be some setting you want to tweak, like JVMHEAPSIZE or AWS_REGION.\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'     \n\n Place holders\n\nPlace holders can be used to separate responsibilities across a company where different roles are working on the same project. For example, developers can create place holders for variables to be filled in by operations.\n\nUse the ~ character to define a place holder for a variable that should be filled in at runtime (i.e. when this breed actually gets deployed), but for which you do not yet know the actual value. \n\nExample - ORACLE_PASSWORD designated as a place holder\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1' \n  ORACLE_PASSWORD: ~    \n\n Resolving variables\n\nUse the $ character to reference other statements in a breed/blueprint. This allows you to dynamically resolve ports and hosts names that we don't know until a deployment is done. You can also resolve to hard coded and published constants from some other part of the blueprint or breed, typically a dependency.\n\n  \nThe $ value is escaped by $$. A more strict notation is $ \n  \n\nVamp host variable\n\nVamp provides just one magic* variable: host. This resolves to the host or ip address of the referenced service. Strictly speaking, the host reference resolves to the gateway agent endpoint, but users do not need to concern themselves with this. Users can think of one-on-one connections where Vamp actually does server-side service discovery to decouple services.\n\n Example - resolving variables from a dependency\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host        # resolves to a host at runtime\n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port  # resolves to a port at runtime\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency's environment variables\nWhat if the backend is configured through some environment variable, but the frontend also needs that information? For example, the encoding type for our database. We can just reference that environment variable using the exact same syntax.\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n      BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n    environment_variables:\n      ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'    injected into the backend MySQL container\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants (see below) allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\nEnvironment variable scope\n\nEnvironment variables can live on different scopes and can be overridden by scopes higher in the scope hierarchy.\nA scope is an area of your breed or blueprint definition that limits the visibility of variables and references inside that scope.\n\nBreed scope: The scope used in all the above examples is the default scope. If you never define any environment_variables in any other place, this will be used.\n\nCluster scope: Will override the breed scope and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override environment variables for all services that belong to a cluster.\n\nService scope: Will override breed scope and cluster scope, and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override all environment variables for a specific service within a cluster.\n\n   \nEffective use of scope is completely dependent on your use case. The various scopes help to separate concerns when multiple people and/or teams work on Vamp artifacts and deployments and need to decouple their effort.\n  \n\n Examples of scope use\n\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\nOverride the JVMHEAPSIZE in production\nUse a place holder\nJust for fun - combine all scopes and references\n\nExample 1\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\n\nUse case: As a devOps-er you want to test one service configured in two different ways at the same time. Your service is configurable using environment variables. In this case we are testing a connection pool setting. \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we just use the breed level environment variables. The traffic is split into a 50/50 divide between both services.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-a\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 30                \n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-b               different breed name, same deployable\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 60                 # different pool size\n\n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nExample 2\nOverride the JVM_HEAP_SIZE in production\n\nUse case: As a developer, you created your service with a default heap size you use on your development laptop and maybe on a test environment. Once your service goes \"live\", an ops guy/gal should be able to override this setting.\n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we override the variable JVMHEAPSIZE for the whole frontend cluster by specifically marking it with .dot-notation cluster.variable \n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                   cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2800          # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200         # will be overridden by deployment level: 2800\n\nExample 3\nUse a place holder\n\nUse case: As a developer, you might not know some value your service needs at runtime, say the Google Anaytics ID your company uses. However, your Node.js frontend needs it! \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint the ~ place holder is used to explicitly demand that a variable is set by a higher scope. When this variable is NOT provided, Vamp will report an error at deploy time.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: 'UA-53758816-1'  # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/node_express:1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: ~               # If not provided at higher scope, \n                                                  # Vamp reports error.\n\nExample 4\nCombine all scopes and references\n\nAs a final example, let's combine some of the examples above and include referenced breeds. In this case, we have two breed artifacts already stored in Vamp and include them by using the ref keyword.\n\nIn the below blueprint:  \n\nwe override all breed scope JVMHEAPSIZE variables with cluster scope environment_variables\nto further tweak the JVMHEAPSIZE for the service frontendapp:1.0-b, we also add service scope environmentvariables for that service.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2400                    # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-a\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-b        \n        environment_variables:           \n          JVMHEAPSIZE: 1800               # overrides the breed level AND cluster level\n          \n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nConstants\n\nSometimes you just want configuration information to be available in a breed or blueprint. You don't need that information to be directly exposed as an environment variable. As a convenience, Vamp allows you to set constants.\nThese are values that cannot be changed during deploy time.\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\n Exammple - using constants\n\n,clusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n        MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n        BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n        SCHEMA: $backend.constants.SCHEMA_NAME\n      dependencies:\n        backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed:\n      name: mysql:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'\n      constants:\n        SCHEMA_NAME: 'customers'    # NOT injected into the backend MySQL container\n\n  \nRead about Vamp gateways\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":214},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/escalations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"escalations-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 100","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nAn escalation is a workflow triggered by an escalation event. Vamp checks for these escalation events using a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. If the events match the escalation handlers defined in the DSL, the action is executed.\n\nAgain: escalation events can be generated by third party systems and they will be handled in the same manner as events created by Vamp SLA workflows. \n\nEscalation handlers\n\nAny escalation that is triggered should be handled by an escalation handler\n\nVamp ships with the following set of escalation handlers - scaleinstances, scalecpu and scale_memory. These handlers can be composed into intricate escalation systems.\n\n scale_instances   \nScales up the number of running instances. It is applied only to the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). You can set upper limits to how far you want to scale out or in, effectively guaranteeing a minimum set of running instances. This is very much like AWS auto-scaling.  \nExample - scale_instances\n,type: scale_instances\ntarget: monarch   Target cluster for the scale up/down.\n                 # If it's not specified, by default it's the \n                 # current cluster where SLA escalations are \n                 # specified.\nminimum: 1       # Minimum number of instances.\nmaximum: 3       # Maximum number of instances.\nscale_by: 1      # Increment/decrement to use on current \n                 # number of running instances.\nscale_cpu \nScales up the number of CPUs per instances. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_cpu\n,type: scale_cpu\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 1\nmaximum: 3 \nscale_by: 0.5\nscale_memory   \nScales up the memory per instance. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_memory  \n,type: scale_memory\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 512     # In MB.\nmaximum: 4096    # In MB.\nscale_by: 512    # In MB.\n\nComposing escalation handlers\n\nVamp has a set of predefined escalation handler types that deal with escalations. You can compose these handlers in the DSL to get the desired outcome of an escalation event. The escalation handlers toall and toone are supported:\n\n to_all  \nThis is a \"group\" escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to all escalation handlers from its list. No order or hierarchy.    \n\nExample - to_all  \n,to_all:\n  escalations:\n     Scale up/down.\n    scale_instances\n    # And notify for each event.\n    notify\nto_one  \nThis is a group escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to each escalation handler (from its list) until one can handle it. On an Escalate event, it will start at the head of the list. During a DeEscalate event is will start at the rear.  \nWhen is this useful? Well, Vamp could try to scale up the service and if that;s not possible anymore (e.g. reached the upper limit of allowed scale) then an email can be sent.  \n\n Example - simple use of to_one\n,to_one:\n  escalations:\n    # First try to escalate.\n    scale_instances\n    # If it's not possible, proceed with notifying.\n    notify\nExample - complex use of to_one  \n,name: monarch\n\ngateways:\n  80: monarch1/port\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  monarch2.password: secret\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch1:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch1\n      deployable: vamp/monarch1\n      ports:\n        port: 80/http\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_HOST: $storage.host\n        DB_PORT: $storage.ports.port\n        STORAGEPASS: $storage.environmentvariables.password\n      \n      dependencies:\n        storage: monarch2\n\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n    \n    sla:\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000\n        lower: 100\n      window:\n        interval: 600\n        cooldown: 600\n      escalations:\n        to_one:\n            escalations:\n              type: scale_instances\n                 First try to scale up storage service.\n                target: monarch2\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              type: scale_instances\n                # If we cannot scale up storage anymore, scale up this.\n                target: monarch1\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              \n  monarch2:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch2\n      deployable: vamp/monarch2\n      ports:\n        port: 3306\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_PASS: password\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n\n  \nRead about Referencing artifacts in Vamp\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":215},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/events","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"events-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events. Vamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions. All events are stored and retrieved using the Event API that is part of Vamp.\n\nExample - JSON \"deployment create\" event\n\n \n Storing events\nVamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .\n\nBasic event rules\n\nAll events stick to some basic rules:\n\nAll data in Vamp are events. \nEvents consist of an event type, one or more event tags and an optional event value. They are described in the format ['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type \nEvent values can be empty or any JSON object.\nEvent timestamps are in ISO8601/RFC3339.\nTimestamps are optional. If not provided, Vamp will insert the current time.\nTimestamps are inclusive for querying.\nEvents can be tagged with metadata. A simple event tag is just single string.\nQuerying data by tag assumes \"AND\" behaviour when multiple tags are supplied, i.e. [\"one\", \"two\"] would only fetch records that are tagged with both.\nSupported event aggregations are: average, min, max and count.\nYou can create custom event types, names should only include alphanumerics, ‘_’ and ‘-’\n\n Event type\nVamp works with a number of default event types and custom event types can also be created using the /events API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type event will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.\n\nDefault event types |  Description\n----------|-----,Archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)\nSynchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)\nEvent | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event\nHealth | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nMetrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nWorkflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner\n\nEvent value\nThe event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If no value is specified, it will be blank\n\n Event tags\nEach event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for stored events and are used for filtering searches and listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a :. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). generictag:specifictag\n\nHow tags are organised\n\nIn all of Vamp's components we follow a REST (resource oriented) schema, for instance:\n/deployments/  \n/deployments/ /clusters/ /services/ \nTagging is done using a very similar schema: \" \", \" : \". For example:\n\n[\n    \"deployments\", \n    \"deployments: \", \n    \"clusters\", \n    \"clusters: \", \n    \"services\", \n    \"services: \"\n]\n\nThis schema allows querying per group and per specific name. Getting all events related to all deployments is done by using tag \"deployments\". Getting events for specific deployment \"deployments: \".\n\n Query events using tags\n\nUsing the tags schema and timestamps, you can do some powerful queries. Either use an exact timestamp or use special range query operators, described on the elastic.co site (elastic.co - Range query).\n\n  \nthe default page size for a set of returned events is 30.\n  \n\nExample queries\n\nGet all events\nResponse time for a cluster\nCurrent sessions for a service\nAll known events for a service\n \n Example 1\nGet all events\n\nThe below query gets ALL metrics events up till now, taking into regard the pagination.\n\n  \nGET request with body - similar to approach used by Elasticsearch.\n  \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 2 \nResponse time for a cluster\n\nThe below query gets the most recent response time events for the \"frontend\" cluster in the \"d9b42796-d8f6-431b-9230-9d316defaf6d\" deployment.\n\nNotice the \"gateways:UUID\", \"metrics:responseTime\" and \"gateways\" tags. This means \"give me the response time of this specific gateway at the gateway level\". The response will echo back the events in the time range with the original set of tags associated with the events. \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n[\n     ,\n     \n]    \n\n Example 3\nCurrent sessions for a service\n\nAnother example is getting the current sessions for a specific service, in this case the monarch_front:0.2 service that is part of the 214615ec-d5e4-473e-a98e-8aa4998b16f4 deployment and lives in the frontend cluster.\n\nNotice we made the search more specific by specifying the \"services\" and then \"service:SERVICE NAME\" tag.\nAlso, we are using relative timestamps: anything later or equal (lte) than \"now\".\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 4\nAll known events for a service\n\nThis below query gives you all the events we have for a specific service, in this case the same service as in example 2. In this way you can get a quick \"health snapshot\" of service, server, cluster or deployment.\n\nNotice we made the search less specific by just providing the \"metrics\" tag and not telling the API which specific one we want.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n Server-sent events (SSE)\n\nEvents can be streamed back directly from Vamp.\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream\n\nIn order to narrow down (filter) events, list of tags could be provided in the request body.\n\n \n\nGET method can be also used with tag parameter (may be more convenient):\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream?tag=archiving&tag=breeds\n\nArchiving\n\nAll changes in artifacts (creation, update or deletion) triggered by REST API calls are archived. We store the type of event and the original representation of the artifact. It's a bit like a Git log. \n\nHere is an example event:\n\n \n\nSearching through the archive is 100% the same as searching for events. The same tagging scheme applies.\nThe following query gives back the last set of delete actions executed in the Vamp API, regardless of the artifact type.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n  \nTry the tutorial Create a workflow that generates events\nRead about Vamp SLA (Service Level Agreement)\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":216},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/gateways","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Gateways","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"gateways-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nGateways are dynmic runtime entities in the Vamp eco-system. They represent load balancer rules to deployment, cluster and service instances. There are two types of gateways:\n\nInternal gateways are created automatically for each deployment cluster and updated using the gateway/deployment API\nExternal gateways are explicitly declared either in a deployment blueprint or using the gateway API\n\nExample - automatically created gateway \n\nThe below gateway is for deployment vamp, cluster sava and port port.  \nThe cluster contains two services sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0, each with two running instances. \n,name: vamp/sava/port            name\nport: 40000/http               # port, either http or tcp, assigned by Vamp\nactive: true                   # is it running - not in case of non (yet) existing routes\nsticky: none\nroutes:                        # routes\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.0.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda3c376-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31463\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda2d915-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31292\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.1.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa3c9e4-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31634\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa37bc3-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31826\n\nGateway Usage\n\nThe gateway API allows for programmable routing. External gateways give an entry point to clusters (optionally specified in deployment blueprints), and allow for canary releasing and A/B testing across deployments.\n\nA gateway defines a set of rules for routing traffic between different services within the same cluster.\nVamp allows you to determine this in three ways:\n\nA condition will target specific traffic.

Each condition has a condition-strength.\n\nRouting is calculated as followed:\n\nFind the first condition that matches the request. Read more about conditions  \nfor example, IOS users\nIf the route exists, send the request to it depending on the condition strength  \nfor example, 10% of IOS users are sent to the route\nIf, based on condition strength, the request should not follow that route, then send request to one from all routes based on their weight.  \nfor example, all non-IOS traffic and 90% of IOS users are routed according to route weight\n\n  \nVamp has to account for all traffic.  \nWhen defining weights, the total weight of all routes must always add up to 100%.\nThis means that in a straight three-way split one service must be given 34% as 33%+33%+33%=99%.  1% can be a lot of traffic in high volume environments.\n  \n\nExample - Route all Firefox and only Firefox users to route service_B:\n\nservice_A:\n  weight: 100%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 0%\n  condition_strength: 100%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\n Example - Route half of Firefox users to serviceB, other half to serviceA (80%) or service_B (20%):\nNon Firefox requests will be just sent to serviceA (80%) or serviceB (20%).\nservice_A:\n  weight: 80%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 20%\n  condition_strength: 50%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\nExample - A/B test two deployments using route weight\nBelow is a basic example, similar to putting both deployments (sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0) in the same cluster.  \nIt is easy to imagine having an older legacy application and the new one and doing a full canary release (or A/B testing) in seamless way by using gateways like this.\n\nDeployment 1: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.0\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.0.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nDeployment 2: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.1\n\n,name: sava:1.1\ngateways:\n  9060/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.1.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nGateway (90% / 10%): POST /api/v1/gateways\n\n,name: sava\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  sava:1.0/sava/port:\n    weight: 90%           condition can be used as well\n  sava:1.1/sava/port:\n    weight: 10%\n\nURL path rewrite\n\nVamp supports URL path rewrite. This can be a powerful solution in defining service APIs (e.g. RESTful) outside of application service.  Path rewrite is defined in the format path: NEW_PATH if CONDITION, where:\n\nNEW_PATH new path to be used; HAProxy variables are supported, e.g. %[path]\nCONDITION condition using HAProxy directives, e.g. matching path, method, headers etc.\n\n Example\nroutes:\n  web/port1:\n    rewrites:\n    path: a if b\n  web/port2:\n    weight: 100%\n\nVamp managed and external routes\n\nVamp managed routes are in the format:\n\ngateway - pointing to another gateway, e.g. it is possible to chain gateways\ndeployment/cluster - pointing to deployment cluster, i.e. services are not 'visible'\ndeployment/cluster/service - pointing to specific service within deployment cluster\n\nAll examples above cover only Vamp managed routes.\nIt is also possible to route traffic to specific IP or hostname and port.\nIn that case IP or hostname and port need to be specified between brackets, e.g. [hostname:port] (and double quotes due to Yaml syntax).\n\nname: mesos\nport: 8080/http\nsticky: route\n\nroutes:\n  \"[192.168.99.100:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n  \"[localhost:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n\n  \nRead about Vamp conditions\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":217},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/references","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Referencing artifacts","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"referencing-artifacts-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 110","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nWith any artifact, Vamp allows you to either use an inline notation or reference the artifact by name. For references, you use the reference keyword or its shorter version ref. Think of it like either using actual values or pointers to a value. This has a big impact on how complex or simple you can make any blueprint, breed or deployment. It also impacts how much knowledge you need to have of all the different artifacts that are used in a typical deployment or blueprint.\n\nVamp assumes that referenced artifcats (the breed called my_breed in the example below) is available to load from its datastore at deploy time. This goes for all basic artifacts in Vamp: SLA's, gateways, conditions, escalations, etc.\n\nExample - reference notation\n\ninline notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          name: my_breed\n          deployable: registry.example.com/app:1.0\n        scale:\n          cpu: 2\n          memory: 1024MB\n          instances: 4\nreference notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          reference: my_breed\n        scale:\n          reference: medium  \n\n Working with references\n\nWhen you begin to work with Vamp, you will probably start with inline artifacts. You have everything in one place and can directly see what properties each artifact has. Later, you can start specialising and basically build a library of often used architectural components. \n\nExample use of references\n\nCreate a library of containers\nFix scales per environment\nReuse a complex condition\n\n Example 1 \nCreate a library of containers\n\nUse case: You have a Redis container you have tweaked and setup exactly the way you want it. You want to use that exact container in all your environments (dev, test, prod etc.). \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a breed and use either the Vamp UI or API to save it (below). Now you can just use the ref: redis:1.0 notation anywhere in a blueprint.\n\nPOST /api/v1/breeds\n\n,name: redis:1.0\ndeployable: redis\nports: 6379/tcp\n\nExample 2\nFix scales per environment\n\nUse case: You want to have a predetermined set of scales you can use per deployment per environment. For instance, a \"mediumproduction\" should be something else than a \"mediumtest\".\n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a scale and use either the Vamp API to save it (below). Now you can use the ref: mediumtest or ref: mediumprod notation anywhere a scale type is required.\n\nPOST /api/v1/scales\n\n,name: medium_prod\ncpu: 2\nmemory: 4096MB\ninstances: 3\n\n,name: medium_test\ncpu: 0.5\nmemory: 1024MB\ninstances: 1\n\n Example 3\nReuse a complex condition\n\nUse case: You have created a complex condition to target a specific part of your traffic. In this case users with a cookie that have a specific session variable set in that cookie. You want to use that condition now and then to do some testing. \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a condition and use either the Vamp API to save it (below). Now you can use the  ref: conditionemptyshopping_cart anywhere that condition is required.\n\n,name: conditionemptyshopping_cart\ncondition: Cookie SHOPSESSION Contains shoppingbasketitems=0 \n\n  \nRead about Vamp workflows\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":218},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"service-discovery-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 135","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery). In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry (microservices.io - service registry).\n\nFor Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:\n\nNo code injection needed.\nNo extra libraries or agents needed.\nplatform/language agnostic: it’s just HTTP.\nEasy integration using ENV variables.\n\nCreate and publish a service\n\n  \nServices do not register themselves. They are explicitly created, registered in the Vamp database and provisioned on the load balancer.\n  \n\nServices are created and published as follows:\n\nThe user describes a service and its desired endpoint port in the Vamp DSL.\nThe service is deployed to the configured container manager by Vamp.\nVamp instructs Vamp Gateway Agent (via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul) to set up service endpoints.\nVamp Gateway Agent takes care of configuring HAProxy, making the services available.\n\nAfter this, you can scale the service up/down or in/out either by hand or using Vamp’s auto scaling functionality. The endpoint is stable.\n\n Discovering a service\n\nSo, how does one service find a dependent service? Services are found by just referencing them in the DSL. Take a look at the following example:\n,name: my_blueprint:1.0\nclusters:\n  myfrontendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: myfrontendservice:0.1\n        deployable: company/frontend:0.1\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        dependencies:\n          backend: mybackendservice:0.3\n        environment_variables:\n         BACKEND_HOST: $backend.host\n         BACKEND_PORT: $backend.ports.jdbc\n      scale:\n        instances: 3         \n  mybackendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: mybackendservice:0.3\n        deployable: company/backend:0.3\n        ports:\n          jdbc: 8080/tcp\n      scale:\n        instances: 4\n\nWe have a frontend cluster and a backend cluster. These are just organisational units.\nThe frontend cluster runs just one version of our service, consisting of three instances.\nThe frontend service has a hard dependency on a backend (tcp) service.\nWe reference the backend by name, my_backend:0.3, and assign it a label, in this case just backend\nWe use the label backend to get the host and a specific port (jdbc) from this backend.\nWe assign these values to environment variables that are exposed in the container runtime.\nAny frontend service now has access to the location of the dependent backend service.\n\nNote that there is no point-to-point wiring. The $backend.host and $backend.ports.jdbc variables resolve to service endpoints Vamp automatically sets up and exposes.\n\nEven though Vamp provides this type of service discovery, it does not put any constraint on other possible solutions. For instance services can use their own approach specific approach using service registry, self-registration etc.\n\nConfigure the gateway-driver\n\nThe gateway-driver section of the Vamp configuration file application.conf configures how traffic should be routed through Vamp Gateway Agent. See the below example on how to configure this:\n\nvamp  \n     \n   \n   \n\nThe reason for the need to configure vamp.gateway-driver.host is that when services are deployed, they need to be able to find Vamp Gateway Agent in their respective networks. This can be a totally different network than where Vamp is running.\nLet's use an example: frontend and backend service, frontend depends on backend - in Vamp DSL that would be 2 clusters (assuming the same deployment).\nThere are different ways how frontend can discover its dependency backend, and to make things simpler Vamp supports using specific environment parameters.\n\n,name: my-web-app\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-frontend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-frontend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.port\n        dependencies:\n          backend: my-backend:1.0.0\n  backend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-backend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-backend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n\nIn this example $backend.host will have the value of the vamp.gateway-driver.host configuration parameter, while $backend.ports.port the next available port from vamp.operation.gateway.port-range.\nfrontend doesn't connect to backend directly but via Vamp Gateway Agent(s) - given on these host and port parameters.\nThis is quite simmilar to common pattern to access any clustered application.\nFor instance if you want to access DB server, you will have an address string based on e.g. DNS name or something simmilar.\nNote that even without Vamp, you would need to setup access to backend in some similar way.\nWith Vamp, access is via VGA's and that allows specific routing (conditions, weights) needed for A/B testing and canary releasing.\n\n  \nRead about using Vamp with virtual hosts\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":219},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.2/sla","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"SLA (Service Level Agreement)","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"sla-v092\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 90","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nSLA stands for \"Service Level Agreement\". Vamp uses it to define a pre-described set of boundaries to a service and the actions that should take place once the service crosses those boundaries. In essence, an SLA and its associated escalation is a workflow that is checked and controlled by Vamp based on the runtime behaviour of a service. SLAs and escalations are defined with the VAMP DSL.\n\nThe SLA event system\n\nYou can define an SLA for each cluster in a blueprint. A common example would be to check if the average response time of the cluster (averaged across all services) is higher or lower than a certain threshold. Under the hood, an SLA workflow creates two distinct events. These are are sent from Vamp and stored to Elasticsearch.\n\nEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is higher than the upper threshold.\nDeEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is lower than the lower threshold.\n\nSLA monitoring is a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. On each run an SLA workflow is executed for each deployment & cluster that has an SLA defined. Within the same SLA definition it's possible to define a list of escalations. Escalations are triggered by escalation events (Escalate/DeEscalate).\n\nThis means escalation events can be generated by the third party systems by sending them to Elasticsearch. This would allow scaling up or down to be triggered by basically any system that can POST a piece of JSON.\n\nSLA's are in essence pieces of code inside Vamp that stick to this event model and can use, if they want, the metrics and event data streaming out of Elasticsearch to make decisions on how things are and should be running.\n\n SLA types\n\nVamp currently ships with the following SLA types:\n\nresponsetimesliding_window\n\nResponse time with sliding window \n\nThe responsetimesliding_window SLA triggers events based on response times. \n\n Example - SLA defined inline in a blueprint.\n\nNotice the SLA is defined per cluster and acts on the first service in the cluster.\n\nNotice how the SLA is defined separately from the escalations. This is key to how Vamp approaches SLA's and how modular and extendable the system is.\n\n,name: sava\n\ngateways:\n  80: sava/webport\n\nclusters:\n\n  sava:                        # the sava cluster\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: monarch\n        deployable: vamp/monarch\n        ports:\n          webport: 80\n\n      scale:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1024MB\n        instances: 2\n\n    sla:                        # SLA applies to the first service in the sava cluster (monarch)\n      # Type of SLA.\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000   # Upper threshold in milliseconds.\n        lower: 100    # Lower threshold in milliseconds.\n      window:\n        interval: 600 # Time period in seconds used for\n                      # average response time aggregation.\n        cooldown: 600 # Time period in seconds.

JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. Workflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times. \n\nVamp ships with three default workflows:\n\nHealth  - checks and stores the status of running services. Events stored by the health workflow are used by the Vamp UI.\nMetrics - stores metrics on running services. Events stored by the metrics workflow are used by the Vamp UI.\nKibana - supports the easy creation of Kibana dashboards.\n\nYou can create your own workflows using Node JS based scripts running inside a Vamp workflow agent container, or use another language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a Docker container to be deployed by Vamp.\n\nSchedules\n\nWorkflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by specific events or rn according to a time schedule. See the examples for each below.\n\n Scheduled as a daemon\nFor example:\nschedule: daemon\n\nTriggered by events\nFor example:\nschedule:\n  event:  event with following tags will trigger the workflow\n  deployments:sava\n  cluster:runner\n\nschedule:  # shortened notation in case of single event (still array can be used as above)\n  event: archive:bluprints\n\nScheduled by time\nperiod, start (optional, by default starts now) and repeat (optional, by default runs forever). The time schedule period is in ISO8601 repeating interval notation.   \nFor example:\nschedule:\n  time:\n    period: P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S\n    start: now  or e.g. start: 2016-12-03T08:15:30Z\n    repeat: 10\n\nExample JavaScript workflow\nThe below examples show a JavaScript workflow with a separately stored JavaScript breed.\nJavaScript breeds are executed by Vamp Workflow Agent (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent).

You can have many deployments from one blueprint and perform actions on each at runtime. Plus, you can turn any running deployment into a blueprint.

This means you reference your breeds (or define them inline) and add runtime configuration to them.\n\nBlueprints allow you to add the following extra properties:\n\nGateways: a stable port where the service can be reached.\nClusters and services: a cluster is a grouping of services with one purpose, i.e. two versions (a/b) of one service.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nDialects: a dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform, i.e. Docker or Mesosphere Marathon.\nScale: the CPU and memory and the amount of instance allocate to a service.\nConditions: how traffic should be directed based on HTTP and/or TCP properties.\nSLA and escalations: SLA definition that controls autoscaling.\n\nExample - key concepts of blueprints\n\n,name: my_blueprint                         Custom blueprint name\ngateways:\n  8080/http: my_frontend/port\nclusters:\n  my_frontend:                            # Custom cluster name.\n  \n    gateways:                             # Gateway for this cluster services.\n      routes:                             # Makes sense only with\n        somecoolbreed:                  # multiple services per cluster.\n          weight: 95%\n          condition: User-Agent = Chrome\n        someotherbreed:                 # Second service.\n          weight: 5%\n          \n    services:                             # List of services\n      breed:\n          ref: somecoolbreed\n        scale:                            # Scale for this service.\n          cpu: 2                          # Number of CPUs per instance.\n          memory: 2048MB                  # Memory per instance (MB/GB units).\n          instances: 2                    # Number of instances\n      breed: \n          ref: someotherbreed           # Another service in the same cluster.  \n        scale: large                      # Notice we used a reference to a \"scale\". \n                                          # More on this later.\n\nGateways\n\nA gateway is a \"stable\" endpoint (or port in simplified sense) that almost never changes. When creating the mapping, it uses the definition (my_frontend/port in this case) from the \"first\" service in the cluster definition you reference. This service can of course be changed, but the gateway port normally doesn't.\n\nPlease take care of setting the /tcp or /http (default) type for the port. Using /http allows Vamp to record more relevant metrics like response times and metrics.\n\nRead more about gateways.\n\n  \ngateways are optional. You can just deploy services and have a home grown method to connect them to some stable, exposable endpoint.\n  \n\n Clusters and services\n\nIn essence, blueprints define a collection of clusters.\nA cluster is a group of different services, which will appear as a single service and serve a single purpose.\n\nCommon use cases would be service A and B in an A/B testing scenario - usually just different\nversions of the same service (e.g. canary release or blue/green deployment).\n\nClusters are configured by defining an array of services. A cluster can be given an arbitrary name. Services are just lists or arrays of breeds.\n\n,mycoolcluster\n  services\n   breed: \n      ref: mycoolservice_A      # reference to an existing breed\n   breed:                       # shortened inline breed\n       name: mycoolservice_B\n       deployable: some_container\n       ...\n\nClusters and services are just organisational items. Vamp uses them to order, reference and control the actual containers and gateways and traffic.\n\n This all seems redundant, right? We have a reference chain of blueprints - gateways - clusters - services - breeds - deployable. However, you need this level of control and granularity in any serious environment where DRY principles are taken seriously and where \"one size fits all\" doesn't fly.\n\nDialects\n\nVamp allows you to use container driver specific tags inside blueprints. We call this a “dialect”.  Dialects effectively enable you to make full use of, for instance, the underlying features like mounting disks, settings commands and providing access to private Docker registries.\n\nWe currently support the following dialects:\n\ndocker:\nmarathon:\n\n Docker dialect\n\nThe following example show how you can mount a volume to a Docker container using the Docker dialect.\n\nExample blueprint - using the Docker dialect\n\n,name: busybox\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox-breed\n        deployable: busybox:latest\n      docker:\n        Volumes:\n          \"/tmp\": ~\n\nVamp will translate this into the proper API call. Inspecting the container after it's deployed should show something similar to this:\n\n...\n\"Volumes\":  ,\n...    \n\n Marathon dialect\n\nThis is an example with Marathon that pulls an image from private repo, mounts some volumes, sets some labels and gets run with an ad hoc command: all taken care of by Marathon.\n  \nWe can provide the marathon: tag either on the service level, or the cluster level. Any marathon: tag set on the service level will override the cluster level as it is more specific. However, in 9 out of 10 cases the cluster level makes the most sense. Later, you can also mix dialects so you can prep your blueprint for multiple environments and run times within one description.\n\nexample blueprint - using the Marathon dialect\n\nNotice the following:\n\nUnder the marathon: tag, we provide the command to run in the container by setting the cmd: tag.\nWe provide a url to some credentials file in the uri array. As described in the Marathon docs (mesosphere.github.io/marathon - using a private Docker repository) this enables Mesos\nto pull from a private registry, in this case registry.example.com where these credentials are set up.\nWe set some labels with some arbitrary metadata.\nWe mount the /tmp to in Read/Write mode.\n\n,name: busy-top:1.0\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox\n        deployable: registry.example.com/busybox:latest\n      marathon:\n       cmd: \"top\"\n       uris:\n         \"https://somehost/somepath/somefilewithdockercredentials\"\n       labels:\n         environment: \"staging\"\n         owner: \"buffy the vamp slayer\"\n       container:\n         volumes:\n           containerPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             hostPath: \"/tmp/\"\n             mode: \"RW\"\n\n Scale\n\nScale is the \"size\" of a deployed service. Usually that means the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory.\n\nScales can be defined inline in a blueprint or they can defined separately and given a unique name. The following example is a scale named \"small\". POST-ing this scale to the /scales REST API endpoint will store it under that name so it can be referenced from other blueprints.\n\nExample scale\n\n,name: small    Custom name.\n\ncpu: 2        # Number of CPUs per instance.\nmemory: 2gb   # Memory per instance, MB/GB units.\ninstances: 2  # Number of instances.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp deployments\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":225},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/breeds","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Breeds","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"breeds-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds are static descriptions of applications and services available for deployment.

By default that would be the public Docker hub, but it could also be a private repo.\nThe default deployable type is a Docker container, but we could also make this explicit by setting type to docker. The following statements are equivalent:\n\n,deployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\n,deployable: \n  type: container/docker\n  definition: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nThis shows the full (expanded) deployable with type and definition.\n\n Other deployables\n\nRunning \"other\" artifacts such as zips or jars heavily depends on the underlying container manager.\nWhen Vamp is set up to run with Marathon (mesosphere.github.io - Marathon), command (or cmd) deployable types can be used.\nIn that case cmd (Marathon REST API - post v2/apps) parameter will have value of deployable.\n\nExample breed - run a custom jar after it has been downloaded \nCombining this definition and the Vamp Marathon dialect  uris parameter allows the requested jar to be downloaded from a remote location (Marathon REST API - uris Array of Strings). \n\n,name: location\nclusters:\n  api:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: location\n        deployable: \n          type: cmd\n          definition: java -jar location.jar\n      marathon:\n        uris: [\"https://myrepolocation_jar\"]\n\n JavaScript deployables \n\nBreeds can have type application/javascript and definition should be a JavaScript script:\n\n,name: hello-world\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    console.log('Hello World Vamp!');\n\nIt is possible to create or update breeds with the API request POST|PUT /api/v1/breeds/ , Javascript script as body and header Content-Type: application/javascript.\n\nPorts\n\nThe ports property is an array of named ports together with their protocol. It describes on what ports the deployables is offering services to the outside world. Let's look at the following breed:\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http\n  admin: 8081/http\n  redis: 9023/tcp   \n\nPorts come in two flavors:\n\n/http HTTP ports are the default type if none is specified. They are always recommended when dealing with HTTP-based services. Vamp can record a lot of interesting metrics like response times, errors etc. Of course, using /tcp will work but you miss out on cool data.\n/tcp Use TCP ports for things like Redis, MySQL etc.\n\n  \n/http notation for ports is required for use of filters.\n  \n\nNotice we can give the ports sensible names. This specific deployable has web port for customer traffic, an admin port for admin access and a redis port for some caching probably. These names come in handy when we later compose different breeds in blueprints.\n\n Dependencies\n\nBreeds can also have dependencies on other breeds. These dependencies should be stated explicitly, similar to how you would do in a Maven pom.xml, a Ruby Gemfile or similar package dependency systems, i.e:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.1\n\nIt is also possible to use wildcard * at the end of the name. This will match any breed name that starts with redis:1.:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.*\n\nIn a lot of cases, dependencies coexist with interpolated environment variables or constants because exact values are not known untill deploy time.  \nRead more about environment variables\n\n  \nRead about Vamp blueprints\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":226},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/conditions","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Conditions","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"conditions-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 70","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nConditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.\nRead more about gateway usage. You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the /conditions endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. \n\nExample - simple inline condition\n\nThis would be used directly inside a blueprint.\n\n,condition_strength: 10%   Amount of traffic for this service in percents.\ncondition: User-Agent = IOS\n\nCreate a condition \n\nCreating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the condition field of a condition.\n\nHowever, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:\n\n| description           | syntax                       | example                  |\n| ----------------------|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| match user agent      | user-agent == value          | user-agent == Firefox    |\n| mismatch user agent   | user-agent != value          | user-agent != Firefox    |\n| match host            | host == value                | host == localhost        |\n| mismatch host         | host != value                | host != localhost       |\n| has cookie            | has cookie value             | has cookie vamp          |\n| misses cookie         | misses cookie value          | misses cookie vamp       |\n| has header            | has header value             | has header ETag          |\n| misses header         | misses header value          | misses header ETag       |\n| match cookie value    | cookie name has value    | cookie vamp has 12345    |\n| mismatch cookie value | cookie name misses value | cookie vamp misses 12345 |\n| header has value      | header name has value   | header vamp has 12345    |\n| header misses value   | header name misses value | header vamp misses 12345 |\n\nAdditional syntax examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - ConditionDefinitionParserSpec.scala.\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nIn order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between  :\n\ncondition: \" hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome \"\n\nHaving multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header\n\"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff\n\n Boolean expression in conditions\n\nVamp supports AND, OR, negation NOT and grouping ( ):\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp\n\nAdditional boolean expression examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - BooleanParserSpec.scala.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp events\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":227},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/deployments","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deployments","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"deployments-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 40","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nA deployment is a \"running\" blueprint. Over time, new blueprints can be merged with existing deployments or parts of the running blueprint can be removed from it. Each deployment can be exported as a blueprint and \ncopy / pasted to another environment, or even to the same environment to function as a clone.\n\nCreate a deployment\n\nYou can create a deployment in the following ways:\n\nSend a POST request to the /deployments endpoint.\nUse the UI to deploy a blueprint using the \"deploy\" button on the \"blueprints\" tab.\nUse the CLI vamp deploy command  \n $ vamp deploy my_blueprint.\n\nThe name of the deployment will be automatically assigned as a UUID (e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000).\n\n Vamp deployment process\n\nOnce we have issued the deployment, Vamp will do the following:\n\nUpdate Vamps internal model.\nIssue and monitor deployment commands to the container platform.\nUpdate the ZooKeeper entry.\nStart collecting metrics.\nMonitor the container platform for changes.\n\nVamp will add runtime information to the deployment model, like start times, resolved ports etc.\n\nDeployment scenarios\n\nA common Vamp deployment scenario is to introduce a new version of the service to an existing cluster, this is what we call a merge. After testing/migration is done, the old or new version can be removed from the cluster, simply called a removal. Let's look at each in turn.\n\n Merge\n\nMerging of new services is performed as a deployment update. You can merge in many ways:\n\nSend a PUT request to the /deployments/  endpoint.\nUse the UI to update a deployment using the \"Edit deployment\" button. \nUse the CLI with a combination of the vamp merge and vamp deploy commands.\n\nIf a service already exists then only the gateways and scale will be updated. Otherwise a new service will be added. If a new cluster doesn't exist in the deployment, it will be added.\n\nLet's deploy a simple service:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    # Specifying only a reference to the breed.\n    breed: monarch_1.0   \n\nAfter this point we may have another version ready for deployment and now instead of only one service, we have added another one:\n\n,name: monarch_1.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  # Some variable needed for our new recommendation engine,\n  # just as an example.\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    # Just a reference and this breed has one dependency:\n    # recommendation_1.0\n    breed: monarch_1.1\n\n  recommendation:\n    breed: recommendation_1.0\n \n\nNow our deployment (in simplified blueprint format) looks like this:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 0%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    \n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nNote that the route weight for monarch_1.1 is 0, i.e. no traffic is sent to it.\nLet's redirect some traffic to our new monarch_1.1 (e.g. 10%):\n\n,clusters:\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 90%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 10%\n\nNote that we can omit other fields like name, parameters and even other clusters (e.g. recommendation) if the change is not relevant to them. In this example we just wanted to update the weights.\n\nIn the last few examples we have shown the following:\n\nA fresh new deployment.\nA canary release with a cluster update and change of the topology (a new cluster was added).\nAn update of the gateways for a cluster - similar to a cluster scale update (instances, cpu, memory).\n\nRemoval\n\nRemoval is done using the REST API DELETE request together with the new blueprint as request body.\nIf a service exists it will be removed, otherwise the request is ignored. If a cluster has no more services left the cluster will be removed completely. Lastly, if a deployment has no more clusters it will be completely removed (destroyed).\n\nLet's use the example from the previous section. Notice the weight is evenly distributed (50/50). \n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 50%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 50%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100\n\nIf we are happy with the new monarch version 1.1, we can proceed with the removal of the old version.\nThis change is applied on the running deployment. We send the following YAML as the body of the DELETE request\nto the /deployments/deployment_UUID endpoint.\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    breed: monarch_1.0\n\nNote that this is the same original blueprint we started with. What we are doing here is basically \"subtracting\" one blueprint from the other, although \"the other\" is a running deployment.\nAfter this operation our deployment is:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 100%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nIn a nutshell: If we say that the first version was A and the second B, then we just did the migration from A to B without downtime:\nA** - A + B - A + B - A - **B\n\nWe could also remove the newer version (monarch_1.1 with/without recommendation cluster) in case that it didn't perform as we expected.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp environment variables\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":228},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/environment-variables","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Environment variables","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"environment-variables-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 50","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds, blueprints and workflows can include a list of environment variables to be injected into the container at runtime. You set environment variables with the environment_variables keyword or its shorter version env, e.g. both examples below are equivalent.\n\n,environment_variables:\n  PORT: 8080\n\n,env:\n  PORT: 8080\n\n'Hard' setting a variable\n\nYou want to \"hard set\" an environment variable, just like doing an export MYVAR=somevalue in a shell. This  variable could be some external dependency you have no direct control over: the endpoint of some service you use that is out of your control. It can also be some setting you want to tweak, like JVMHEAPSIZE or AWS_REGION.\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'     \n\n Place holders\n\nPlace holders can be used to separate responsibilities across a company where different roles are working on the same project. For example, developers can create place holders for variables to be filled in by operations.\n\nUse the ~ character to define a place holder for a variable that should be filled in at runtime (i.e. when this breed actually gets deployed), but for which you do not yet know the actual value. \n\nExample - ORACLE_PASSWORD designated as a place holder\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1' \n  ORACLE_PASSWORD: ~    \n\n Resolving variables\n\nUse the $ character to reference other statements in a breed/blueprint. This allows you to dynamically resolve ports and hosts names that we don't know until a deployment is done. You can also resolve to hard coded and published constants from some other part of the blueprint or breed, typically a dependency.\n\n  \nThe $ value is escaped by $$. A more strict notation is $ \n  \n\nVamp host variable\n\nVamp provides just one magic* variable: host. This resolves to the host or ip address of the referenced service. Strictly speaking, the host reference resolves to the gateway agent endpoint, but users do not need to concern themselves with this. Users can think of one-on-one connections where Vamp actually does server-side service discovery to decouple services.\n\n Example - resolving variables from a dependency\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host        # resolves to a host at runtime\n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port  # resolves to a port at runtime\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency's environment variables\nWhat if the backend is configured through some environment variable, but the frontend also needs that information? For example, the encoding type for our database. We can just reference that environment variable using the exact same syntax.\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n      BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n    environment_variables:\n      ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'    injected into the backend MySQL container\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants (see below) allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\nEnvironment variable scope\n\nEnvironment variables can live on different scopes and can be overridden by scopes higher in the scope hierarchy.\nA scope is an area of your breed or blueprint definition that limits the visibility of variables and references inside that scope.\n\nBreed scope: The scope used in all the above examples is the default scope. If you never define any environment_variables in any other place, this will be used.\n\nCluster scope: Will override the breed scope and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override environment variables for all services that belong to a cluster.\n\nService scope: Will override breed scope and cluster scope, and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override all environment variables for a specific service within a cluster.\n\n   \nEffective use of scope is completely dependent on your use case. The various scopes help to separate concerns when multiple people and/or teams work on Vamp artifacts and deployments and need to decouple their effort.\n  \n\n Examples of scope use\n\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\nOverride the JVMHEAPSIZE in production\nUse a place holder\nJust for fun - combine all scopes and references\n\nExample 1\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\n\nUse case: As a devOps-er you want to test one service configured in two different ways at the same time. Your service is configurable using environment variables. In this case we are testing a connection pool setting. \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we just use the breed level environment variables. The traffic is split into a 50/50 divide between both services.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-a\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 30                \n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-b               different breed name, same deployable\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 60                 # different pool size\n\n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nExample 2\nOverride the JVM_HEAP_SIZE in production\n\nUse case: As a developer, you created your service with a default heap size you use on your development laptop and maybe on a test environment. Once your service goes \"live\", an ops guy/gal should be able to override this setting.\n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we override the variable JVMHEAPSIZE for the whole frontend cluster by specifically marking it with .dot-notation cluster.variable \n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                   cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2800          # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200         # will be overridden by deployment level: 2800\n\nExample 3\nUse a place holder\n\nUse case: As a developer, you might not know some value your service needs at runtime, say the Google Anaytics ID your company uses. However, your Node.js frontend needs it! \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint the ~ place holder is used to explicitly demand that a variable is set by a higher scope. When this variable is NOT provided, Vamp will report an error at deploy time.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: 'UA-53758816-1'  # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/node_express:1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: ~               # If not provided at higher scope, \n                                                  # Vamp reports error.\n\nExample 4\nCombine all scopes and references\n\nAs a final example, let's combine some of the examples above and include referenced breeds.

You don't need that information to be directly exposed as an environment variable. As a convenience, Vamp allows you to set constants.\nThese are values that cannot be changed during deploy time.\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\n Exammple - using constants\n\n,clusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n        MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n        BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n        SCHEMA: $backend.constants.SCHEMA_NAME\n      dependencies:\n        backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed:\n      name: mysql:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'\n      constants:\n        SCHEMA_NAME: 'customers'    # NOT injected into the backend MySQL container\n\n  \nRead about Vamp gateways\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":229},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/escalations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"escalations-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 100","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nAn escalation is a workflow triggered by an escalation event. Vamp checks for these escalation events using a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. If the events match the escalation handlers defined in the DSL, the action is executed.\n\nAgain: escalation events can be generated by third party systems and they will be handled in the same manner as events created by Vamp SLA workflows. \n\nEscalation handlers\n\nAny escalation that is triggered should be handled by an escalation handler\n\nVamp ships with the following set of escalation handlers - scaleinstances, scalecpu and scale_memory. These handlers can be composed into intricate escalation systems.\n\n scale_instances   \nScales up the number of running instances. It is applied only to the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). You can set upper limits to how far you want to scale out or in, effectively guaranteeing a minimum set of running instances. This is very much like AWS auto-scaling.  \nExample - scale_instances\n,type: scale_instances\ntarget: monarch   Target cluster for the scale up/down.\n                 # If it's not specified, by default it's the \n                 # current cluster where SLA escalations are \n                 # specified.\nminimum: 1       # Minimum number of instances.\nmaximum: 3       # Maximum number of instances.\nscale_by: 1      # Increment/decrement to use on current \n                 # number of running instances.\nscale_cpu \nScales up the number of CPUs per instances. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_cpu\n,type: scale_cpu\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 1\nmaximum: 3 \nscale_by: 0.5\nscale_memory   \nScales up the memory per instance. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  \n Example - scale_memory  \n,type: scale_memory\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 512     # In MB.\nmaximum: 4096    # In MB.\nscale_by: 512    # In MB.\n\nComposing escalation handlers\n\nVamp has a set of predefined escalation handler types that deal with escalations. You can compose these handlers in the DSL to get the desired outcome of an escalation event. The escalation handlers toall and toone are supported:\n\n to_all  \nThis is a \"group\" escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to all escalation handlers from its list. No order or hierarchy.    \n\nExample - to_all  \n,to_all:\n  escalations:\n     Scale up/down.\n    scale_instances\n    # And notify for each event.\n    notify\nto_one  \nThis is a group escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to each escalation handler (from its list) until one can handle it. On an Escalate event, it will start at the head of the list. During a DeEscalate event is will start at the rear.  \nWhen is this useful? Well, Vamp could try to scale up the service and if that;s not possible anymore (e.g. reached the upper limit of allowed scale) then an email can be sent.  \n\n Example - simple use of to_one\n,to_one:\n  escalations:\n    # First try to escalate.\n    scale_instances\n    # If it's not possible, proceed with notifying.\n    notify\nExample - complex use of to_one  \n,name: monarch\n\ngateways:\n  80: monarch1/port\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  monarch2.password: secret\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch1:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch1\n      deployable: vamp/monarch1\n      ports:\n        port: 80/http\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_HOST: $storage.host\n        DB_PORT: $storage.ports.port\n        STORAGEPASS: $storage.environmentvariables.password\n      \n      dependencies:\n        storage: monarch2\n\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n    \n    sla:\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000\n        lower: 100\n      window:\n        interval: 600\n        cooldown: 600\n      escalations:\n        to_one:\n            escalations:\n              type: scale_instances\n                 First try to scale up storage service.\n                target: monarch2\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              type: scale_instances\n                # If we cannot scale up storage anymore, scale up this.\n                target: monarch1\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              \n  monarch2:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch2\n      deployable: vamp/monarch2\n      ports:\n        port: 3306\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_PASS: password\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n\n  \nRead about Referencing artifacts in Vamp\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":230},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/events","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"events-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events. Vamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions. All events are stored and retrieved using the Event API that is part of Vamp.\n\nExample - JSON \"deployment create\" event\n\n \n Storing events\nVamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .\n\nBasic event rules\n\nAll events stick to some basic rules:\n\nAll data in Vamp are events. \nEvents consist of an event type, one or more event tags and an optional event value. They are described in the format ['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type \nEvent values can be empty or any JSON object.\nEvent timestamps are in ISO8601/RFC3339.\nTimestamps are optional. If not provided, Vamp will insert the current time.\nTimestamps are inclusive for querying.\nEvents can be tagged with metadata. A simple event tag is just single string.\nQuerying data by tag assumes \"AND\" behaviour when multiple tags are supplied, i.e. [\"one\", \"two\"] would only fetch records that are tagged with both.\nSupported event aggregations are: average, min, max and count.\nYou can create custom event types, names should only include alphanumerics, ‘_’ and ‘-’\n\n Event type\nVamp works with a number of default event types and custom event types can also be created using the /events API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type event will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.\n\nDefault event types |  Description\n----------|-----,Archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)\nSynchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)\nEvent | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event\nHealth | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nMetrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nAllocation | Generated by the allocation workflow used to calculate resource usage\nWorkflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner\n\nEvent value\nThe event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If no value is specified, it will be blank\n\n Event tags\nEach event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for stored events and are used for filtering searches and listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a :. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). generictag:specifictag\n\nHow tags are organised\n\nIn all of Vamp's components we follow a REST (resource oriented) schema, for instance:\n/deployments/  \n/deployments/ /clusters/ /services/ \nTagging is done using a very similar schema: \" \", \" : \". For example:\n\n[\n    \"deployments\", \n    \"deployments: \", \n    \"clusters\", \n    \"clusters: \", \n    \"services\", \n    \"services: \"\n]\n\nThis schema allows querying per group and per specific name. Getting all events related to all deployments is done by using tag \"deployments\". Getting events for specific deployment \"deployments: \".\n\n Query events using tags\n\nUsing the tags schema and timestamps, you can do some powerful queries. Either use an exact timestamp or use special range query operators, described on the elastic.co site (elastic.co - Range query).\n\n  \nthe default page size for a set of returned events is 30.\n  \n\nExample queries\n\nGet all events\nResponse time for a cluster\nCurrent sessions for a service\nAll known events for a service\n \n Example 1\nGet all events\n\nThe below query gets ALL metrics events up till now, taking into regard the pagination.\n\n  \nGET request with body - similar to approach used by Elasticsearch.\n  \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 2 \nResponse time for a cluster\n\nThe below query gets the most recent response time events for the \"frontend\" cluster in the \"d9b42796-d8f6-431b-9230-9d316defaf6d\" deployment.\n\nNotice the \"gateways:UUID\", \"metrics:responseTime\" and \"gateways\" tags. This means \"give me the response time of this specific gateway at the gateway level\". The response will echo back the events in the time range with the original set of tags associated with the events. \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n[\n     ,\n     \n]    \n\n Example 3\nCurrent sessions for a service\n\nAnother example is getting the current sessions for a specific service, in this case the monarch_front:0.2 service that is part of the 214615ec-d5e4-473e-a98e-8aa4998b16f4 deployment and lives in the frontend cluster.\n\nNotice we made the search more specific by specifying the \"services\" and then \"service:SERVICE NAME\" tag.\nAlso, we are using relative timestamps: anything later or equal (lte) than \"now\".\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 4\nAll known events for a service\n\nThis below query gives you all the events we have for a specific service, in this case the same service as in example 2. In this way you can get a quick \"health snapshot\" of service, server, cluster or deployment.\n\nNotice we made the search less specific by just providing the \"metrics\" tag and not telling the API which specific one we want.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n Server-sent events (SSE)\n\nEvents can be streamed back directly from Vamp.\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream\n\nIn order to narrow down (filter) events, list of tags could be provided in the request body.\n\n \n\nGET method can be also used with tag parameter (may be more convenient):\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream?tag=archiving&tag=breeds\n\nArchiving\n\nAll changes in artifacts (creation, update or deletion) triggered by REST API calls are archived. We store the type of event and the original representation of the artifact. It's a bit like a Git log. \n\nHere is an example event:\n\n \n\nSearching through the archive is 100% the same as searching for events. The same tagging scheme applies.\nThe following query gives back the last set of delete actions executed in the Vamp API, regardless of the artifact type.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n  \nTry the tutorial Create a workflow that generates events\nRead about Vamp SLA (Service Level Agreement)\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":231},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/gateways","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Gateways","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"gateways-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nGateways are dynamic runtime entities in the Vamp eco-system. They represent load balancer rules to deployment, cluster and service instances. There are two types of gateways:\n\nInternal gateways are created automatically for each deployment cluster and updated using the gateway/deployment API\nExternal gateways are explicitly declared either in a deployment blueprint or using the gateway API\n\nExample - automatically created gateway \n\nThe below gateway is for deployment vamp, cluster sava and port port.  \nThe cluster contains two services sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0, each with two running instances. \n,name: vamp/sava/port            name\nport: 40000/http               # port, either http or tcp, assigned by Vamp\nactive: true                   # is it running - not in case of non (yet) existing routes\nsticky: none\nroutes:                        # routes\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.0.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda3c376-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31463\n    name: vamp_6fd83b1fd01f7dd9eb7f.cda2d915-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31292\n  vamp/sava/sava:1.1.0/port:\n    weight: 50%\n    instances:\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa3c9e4-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31634\n    name: vamp_2e2fc6ab8a1cdbe79dc3.caa37bc3-ae26-11e5-91fb-0242f7e42bf3\n      host: default\n      port: 31826\n\nGateway Usage\n\nThe gateway API allows for programmable routing. External gateways give an entry point to clusters (optionally specified in deployment blueprints), and allow for canary releasing and A/B testing across deployments.\n\nA gateway defines a set of rules for routing traffic between different services within the same cluster.\nVamp allows you to determine this in three ways:\n\nA condition will target specific traffic. Read more about conditions  \nfor example, IOS users\nThe condition_strength targets a percentage of traffic matching a condition  \nfor example, 10% of IOS users\nThe weight for each available route (%) defines the distribution of all remaining traffic (not matching or not targetted by a condition)  \nfor example, 100% of all traffic, except the targetted 10% of IOS users\n\n Routes, condition-strength and weights\n\nEach route can have a weight and one or more conditions (see boolean expression in conditions). Each condition has a condition-strength.\n\nRouting is calculated as followed:\n\nFind the first condition that matches the request. Read more about conditions  \nfor example, IOS users\nIf the route exists, send the request to it depending on the condition strength  \nfor example, 10% of IOS users are sent to the route\nIf, based on condition strength, the request should not follow that route, then send request to one from all routes based on their weight.  \nfor example, all non-IOS traffic and 90% of IOS users are routed according to route weight\n\n  \nVamp has to account for all traffic.  \nWhen defining weights, the total weight of all routes must always add up to 100%.\nThis means that in a straight three-way split one service must be given 34% as 33%+33%+33%=99%.  1% can be a lot of traffic in high volume environments.\n  \n\nExample - Route all Firefox and only Firefox users to route service_B:\n\nservice_A:\n  weight: 100%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 0%\n  condition_strength: 100%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\n Example - Route half of Firefox users to serviceB, other half to serviceA (80%) or service_B (20%):\nNon Firefox requests will be just sent to serviceA (80%) or serviceB (20%).\nservice_A:\n  weight: 80%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 20%\n  condition_strength: 50%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\nExample - A/B test two deployments using route weight\nBelow is a basic example, similar to putting both deployments (sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0) in the same cluster.  \nIt is easy to imagine having an older legacy application and the new one and doing a full canary release (or A/B testing) in seamless way by using gateways like this.\n\nDeployment 1: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.0\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.0.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nDeployment 2: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.1\n\n,name: sava:1.1\ngateways:\n  9060/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.1.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nGateway (90% / 10%): POST /api/v1/gateways\n\n,name: sava\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  sava:1.0/sava/port:\n    weight: 90%           condition can be used as well\n  sava:1.1/sava/port:\n    weight: 10%\n\nURL path rewrite\n\nVamp supports URL path rewrite. This can be a powerful solution in defining service APIs (e.g. RESTful) outside of application service.  Path rewrite is defined in the format path: NEW_PATH if CONDITION, where:\n\nNEW_PATH new path to be used; HAProxy variables are supported, e.g. %[path]\nCONDITION condition using HAProxy directives, e.g. matching path, method, headers etc.\n\n Example\nroutes:\n  web/port1:\n    rewrites:\n    path: a if b\n  web/port2:\n    weight: 100%\n\nVamp managed and external routes\n\nVamp managed routes are in the format:\n\ngateway - pointing to another gateway, e.g. it is possible to chain gateways\ndeployment/cluster - pointing to deployment cluster, i.e. services are not 'visible'\ndeployment/cluster/service - pointing to specific service within deployment cluster\n\nAll examples above cover only Vamp managed routes.\nIt is also possible to route traffic to specific IP or hostname and port.\nIn that case IP or hostname and port need to be specified between brackets, e.g. [hostname:port] (and double quotes due to Yaml syntax).\n\nname: mesos\nport: 8080/http\nsticky: route\n\nroutes:\n  \"[192.168.99.100:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n  \"[localhost:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n\n  \nRead about Vamp conditions\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":232},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/references","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Referencing artifacts","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"referencing-artifacts-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 110","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nWith any artifact, Vamp allows you to either use an inline notation or reference the artifact by name. For references, you use the reference keyword or its shorter version ref. Think of it like either using actual values or pointers to a value. This has a big impact on how complex or simple you can make any blueprint, breed or deployment. It also impacts how much knowledge you need to have of all the different artifacts that are used in a typical deployment or blueprint.\n\nVamp assumes that referenced artifcats (the breed called my_breed in the example below) is available to load from its datastore at deploy time. This goes for all basic artifacts in Vamp: SLA's, gateways, conditions, escalations, etc.\n\nExample - reference notation\n\ninline notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          name: my_breed\n          deployable: registry.example.com/app:1.0\n        scale:\n          cpu: 2\n          memory: 1024MB\n          instances: 4\nreference notation\n\n,name: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          reference: my_breed\n        scale:\n          reference: medium  \n\n Working with references\n\nWhen you begin to work with Vamp, you will probably start with inline artifacts. You have everything in one place and can directly see what properties each artifact has. Later, you can start specialising and basically build a library of often used architectural components. \n\nExample use of references\n\nCreate a library of containers\nFix scales per environment\nReuse a complex condition\n\n Example 1 \nCreate a library of containers\n\nUse case: You have a Redis container you have tweaked and setup exactly the way you want it. You want to use that exact container in all your environments (dev, test, prod etc.). \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a breed and use either the Vamp UI or API to save it (below).

In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry (microservices.io - service registry).\n\nFor Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:\n\nNo code injection needed.\nNo extra libraries or agents needed.\nplatform/language agnostic: it’s just HTTP.\nEasy integration using ENV variables.\n\nCreate and publish a service\n\n  \nServices do not register themselves. They are explicitly created, registered in the Vamp database and provisioned on the load balancer.\n  \n\nServices are created and published as follows:\n\nThe user describes a service and its desired endpoint port in the Vamp DSL.\nThe service is deployed to the configured container manager by Vamp.\nVamp instructs Vamp Gateway Agent (via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul) to set up service endpoints.\nVamp Gateway Agent takes care of configuring HAProxy, making the services available.\n\nAfter this, you can scale the service up/down or in/out either by hand or using Vamp’s auto scaling functionality. The endpoint is stable.\n\n Discovering a service\n\nSo, how does one service find a dependent service? Services are found by just referencing them in the DSL. Take a look at the following example:\n,name: my_blueprint:1.0\nclusters:\n  myfrontendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: myfrontendservice:0.1\n        deployable: company/frontend:0.1\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        dependencies:\n          backend: mybackendservice:0.3\n        environment_variables:\n         BACKEND_HOST: $backend.host\n         BACKEND_PORT: $backend.ports.jdbc\n      scale:\n        instances: 3         \n  mybackendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: mybackendservice:0.3\n        deployable: company/backend:0.3\n        ports:\n          jdbc: 8080/tcp\n      scale:\n        instances: 4\n\nWe have a frontend cluster and a backend cluster. These are just organisational units.\nThe frontend cluster runs just one version of our service, consisting of three instances.\nThe frontend service has a hard dependency on a backend (tcp) service.\nWe reference the backend by name, my_backend:0.3, and assign it a label, in this case just backend\nWe use the label backend to get the host and a specific port (jdbc) from this backend.\nWe assign these values to environment variables that are exposed in the container runtime.\nAny frontend service now has access to the location of the dependent backend service.\n\nNote that there is no point-to-point wiring. The $backend.host and $backend.ports.jdbc variables resolve to service endpoints Vamp automatically sets up and exposes.\n\nEven though Vamp provides this type of service discovery, it does not put any constraint on other possible solutions. For instance services can use their own approach specific approach using service registry, self-registration etc.\n\nConfigure the gateway-driver\n\nThe gateway-driver section of the Vamp configuration file application.conf configures how traffic should be routed through Vamp Gateway Agent. See the below example on how to configure this:\n\nvamp  \n     \n   \n   \n\nThe reason for the need to configure vamp.gateway-driver.host is that when services are deployed, they need to be able to find Vamp Gateway Agent in their respective networks. This can be a totally different network than where Vamp is running.\nLet's use an example: frontend and backend service, frontend depends on backend - in Vamp DSL that would be 2 clusters (assuming the same deployment).\nThere are different ways how frontend can discover its dependency backend, and to make things simpler Vamp supports using specific environment parameters.\n\n,name: my-web-app\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-frontend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-frontend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.port\n        dependencies:\n          backend: my-backend:1.0.0\n  backend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-backend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-backend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n\nIn this example $backend.host will have the value of the vamp.gateway-driver.host configuration parameter, while $backend.ports.port the next available port from vamp.operation.gateway.port-range.\nfrontend doesn't connect to backend directly but via Vamp Gateway Agent(s) - given on these host and port parameters.\nThis is quite simmilar to common pattern to access any clustered application.\nFor instance if you want to access DB server, you will have an address string based on e.g. DNS name or something simmilar.\nNote that even without Vamp, you would need to setup access to backend in some similar way.\nWith Vamp, access is via VGA's and that allows specific routing (conditions, weights) needed for A/B testing and canary releasing.\n\n  \nRead about using Vamp with virtual hosts\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":234},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.3/sla","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"SLA (Service Level Agreement)","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"sla-v093\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 90","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nSLA stands for \"Service Level Agreement\". Vamp uses it to define a pre-described set of boundaries to a service and the actions that should take place once the service crosses those boundaries. In essence, an SLA and its associated escalation is a workflow that is checked and controlled by Vamp based on the runtime behaviour of a service. SLAs and escalations are defined with the VAMP DSL.\n\nThe SLA event system\n\nYou can define an SLA for each cluster in a blueprint. A common example would be to check if the average response time of the cluster (averaged across all services) is higher or lower than a certain threshold. Under the hood, an SLA workflow creates two distinct events. These are are sent from Vamp and stored to Elasticsearch.\n\nEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is higher than the upper threshold.\nDeEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is lower than the lower threshold.\n\nSLA monitoring is a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. On each run an SLA workflow is executed for each deployment & cluster that has an SLA defined. Within the same SLA definition it's possible to define a list of escalations. Escalations are triggered by escalation events (Escalate/DeEscalate).\n\nThis means escalation events can be generated by the third party systems by sending them to Elasticsearch. This would allow scaling up or down to be triggered by basically any system that can POST a piece of JSON.\n\nSLA's are in essence pieces of code inside Vamp that stick to this event model and can use, if they want, the metrics and event data streaming out of Elasticsearch to make decisions on how things are and should be running.\n\n SLA types\n\nVamp currently ships with the following SLA types:\n\nresponsetimesliding_window\n\nResponse time with sliding window \n\nThe responsetimesliding_window SLA triggers events based on response times. \n\n Example - SLA defined inline in a blueprint.\n\nNotice the SLA is defined per cluster and acts on the first service in the cluster.\n\nNotice how the SLA is defined separately from the escalations. This is key to how Vamp approaches SLA's and how modular and extendable the system is.\n\n,name: sava\n\ngateways:\n  80: sava/webport\n\nclusters:\n\n  sava:                        # the sava cluster\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: monarch\n        deployable: vamp/monarch\n        ports:\n          webport: 80\n\n      scale:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1024MB\n        instances: 2\n\n    sla:                        # SLA applies to the first service in the sava cluster (monarch)\n      # Type of SLA.\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000   # Upper threshold in milliseconds.\n        lower: 100    # Lower threshold in milliseconds.\n      window:\n        interval: 600 # Time period in seconds used for\n                      # average response time aggregation.\n        cooldown: 600 # Time period in seconds.

JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. Workflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times. \n\nVamp ships with four default workflows:\n\nHealth  - checks and stores the status of running services.

Events stored by the metrics workflow are used by the Vamp UI.\nKibana - supports the easy creation of Kibana dashboards.\nAllocation - calculates resource usage (CPU, memory)\n\nYou can create your own workflows using Node JS based scripts running inside a Vamp workflow agent container, or use another language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a Docker container to be deployed by Vamp.\n\nSchedules\n\nWorkflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by specific events or rn according to a time schedule. See the examples for each below.\n\n Scheduled as a daemon\nFor example:\nschedule: daemon\n\nTriggered by events\nFor example:\nschedule:\n  event:  event with following tags will trigger the workflow\n  deployments:sava\n  cluster:runner\n\nschedule:  # shortened notation in case of single event (still array can be used as above)\n  event: archive:bluprints\n\nScheduled by time\nperiod, start (optional, by default starts now) and repeat (optional, by default runs forever). The time schedule period is in ISO8601 repeating interval notation.   \nFor example:\nschedule:\n  time:\n    period: P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S\n    start: now  or e.g. start: 2016-12-03T08:15:30Z\n    repeat: 10\n\nExample JavaScript workflow\nThe below examples show a JavaScript workflow with a separately stored JavaScript breed.\nJavaScript breeds are executed by Vamp Workflow Agent (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent).

This means you reference your breeds (or define them inline) and add runtime configuration to them. Blueprints can be created and edited using the Vamp Domain Specific Language (DSL). Vamp tracks all revisions made to artifacts, so you can check back and compare the current blueprint against a previous version.\n\nDocker compose\n\nThe Vamp UI includes a handy tool to import Docker Compose files and convert these into the Vamp DSL format for deployment in Vamp. Note that some fields may need manual adjustment after conversion (see comments attached to the generated blueprint for details). \n\n Blueprint artifacts\n\nBlueprints allow you to specify the following properties:\n\nGateways: a stable port where the service can be reached.\nClusters and services: a cluster is a grouping of services with one purpose, i.e. two versions (a/b) of one service.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nDialects: a dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform, i.e. Docker or Mesosphere Marathon.\nScale: the CPU and memory and the amount of instance allocate to a service.\nConditions: how traffic should be directed based on HTTP and/or TCP properties.\nSLA and escalations: SLA definition that controls autoscaling.\nHealth: The health checks to be applied to a service, cluster or breed.\n\nExample - key concepts of blueprints\n\n,name: my_blueprint                         Custom blueprint name\ngateways:\n  8080/http: my_frontend/port\nclusters:\n  my_frontend:                            # Custom cluster name.\n  \n    gateways:                             # Gateway for this cluster services.\n      routes:                             # Makes sense only with\n        somecoolbreed:                  # multiple services per cluster.\n          weight: 95%\n          condition: User-Agent = Chrome\n        someotherbreed:                 # Second service.\n          weight: 5%\n          \n    services:                             # List of services\n      breed:\n          ref: somecoolbreed\n        scale:                            # Scale for this service.\n          cpu: 2                          # Number of CPUs per instance.\n          memory: 2048MB                  # Memory per instance (MB/GB units).\n          instances: 2                    # Number of instances\n      breed: \n          ref: someotherbreed           # Another service in the same cluster.  \n        scale: large                      # Notice we used a reference to a \"scale\". \n                                          # More on this later.\n\nGateways\n\nA gateway is a \"stable\" endpoint (or port in simplified sense) that almost never changes. When creating the mapping, it uses the definition (my_frontend/port in this case) from the \"first\" service in the cluster definition you reference. This service can of course be changed, but the gateway port normally doesn't.\n\nPlease take care of setting the /tcp or /http (default) type for the port. Using /http allows Vamp to record more relevant metrics like response times and metrics.\n\nRead more about gateways.\n\n  \ngateways are optional. You can just deploy services and have a home grown method to connect them to some stable, exposable endpoint.\n  \n\n Clusters and services\n\nIn essence, blueprints define a collection of clusters.\nA cluster is a group of different services, which will appear as a single service and serve a single purpose.\n\nCommon use cases would be service A and B in an A/B testing scenario - usually just different\nversions of the same service (e.g. canary release or blue/green deployment).\n\nClusters are configured by defining an array of services. A cluster can be given an arbitrary name. Services are just lists or arrays of breeds.\n\n,mycoolcluster\n  services\n   breed: \n      ref: mycoolservice_A      # reference to an existing breed\n   breed:                       # shortened inline breed\n       name: mycoolservice_B\n       deployable: some_container\n       ...\n\nClusters and services are just organisational items. Vamp uses them to order, reference and control the actual containers and gateways and traffic.\n\n This all seems redundant, right? We have a reference chain of blueprints - gateways - clusters - services - breeds - deployable. However, you need this level of control and granularity in any serious environment where DRY principles are taken seriously and where \"one size fits all\" doesn't fly.\n\nScale\n\nScale is the \"size\" of a deployed service. Usually that means the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory.\n\nScales can be defined inline in a blueprint or they can defined separately and given a unique name. The following example is a scale named \"small\". POST-ing this scale to the /scales REST API endpoint will store it under that name so it can be referenced from other blueprints.\n\n Example scale\n\n,name: small   # Custom name.\n\ncpu: 2        # Number of CPUs per instance.\nmemory: 2gb   # Memory per instance, MB/GB units.\ninstances: 2  # Number of instances.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp breeds\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":240},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/breeds","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Breeds","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"breeds-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nBreeds are static descriptions of applications and services available for deployment. Each breed is described by the DSL in YAML notation or JSON, whatever you like. This description includes name, version, available parameters, dependencies etc.\nTo a certain degree, you could compare a breed to a Maven artifact or a Ruby Gem description.  \nVamp tracks all revisions made to artifacts, so you can check back and compare a current breed against a previous version.\n\nBreeds allow you to set the following properties:\n\nDeployable: the name of actual container or command that should be run.\nPorts: a map of ports your container exposes.\nDependencies: a list of other breeds this breed depends on.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nHealth checks: a list of health checks to perform on this breed (note that these will be overridden by health checks defined on the service or cluster level)\n\n  \nThe breeds listed below are required by system workflows and should not be deleted:\n\nallocation\nhealth\nkibana\nmetrics\nvamp-workflow-javascript\n  \n\nDeployable\n\nDeployables are pointers to the actual artifacts that get deployed. Vamp supports Docker containers or can support any other artifacts supported by your container manager. \n\n Example breed - deploy a Docker container\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http   \n\nThis breed, with a unique name, describes a deployable and the port it works on. \n\nDocker deployables\n\nDocker images are pulled by your container manager from any of the repositories configured. By default that would be the public Docker hub, but it could also be a private repo.\nThe default deployable type is a Docker container, but we could also make this explicit by setting type to docker. The following statements are equivalent:\n\n,deployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\n,deployable: \n  type: container/docker\n  definition: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nThis shows the full (expanded) deployable with type and definition.\n\n JavaScript deployables \n\nBreeds can have type application/javascript and definition should be a JavaScript script:\n\n,name: hello-world\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    console.log('Hello World Vamp!');\n\nIt is possible to create or update breeds with the API request POST|PUT /api/v1/breeds/ , Javascript script as body and header Content-Type: application/javascript.\n\nOther deployable types\n\nRunning \"other\" artifacts such as zips or jars heavily depends on the underlying container manager.\nWhen Vamp is set up to run with Marathon (mesosphere.github.io - Marathon), command (or cmd) deployable types can be used.\nIn that case cmd (Marathon REST API - post v2/apps) parameter will have value of deployable.\n\n Example breed - run a custom jar after it has been downloaded \nCombining this definition and the Vamp Marathon dialect  uris parameter allows the requested jar to be downloaded from a remote location (Marathon REST API - uris Array of Strings). \n\n,name: location\nclusters:\n  api:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: location\n        deployable: \n          type: cmd\n          definition: java -jar location.jar\n      marathon:\n        uris: [\"https://myrepolocation_jar\"]\n\nPorts\n\nThe ports property is an array of named ports together with their protocol. It describes on what ports the deployables is offering services to the outside world. Let's look at the following breed:\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http\n  admin: 8081/http\n  redis: 9023/tcp   \n\nPorts come in two flavors:\n\n/http HTTP ports are the default type if none is specified. They are always recommended when dealing with HTTP-based services. Vamp can record a lot of interesting metrics like response times, errors etc. Of course, using /tcp will work but you miss out on cool data.\n/tcp Use TCP ports for things like Redis, MySQL etc.\n\n  \n/http notation for ports is required for use of filters.\n  \n\nNotice we can give the ports sensible names. This specific deployable has web port for customer traffic, an admin port for admin access and a redis port for some caching probably. These names come in handy when we later compose different breeds in blueprints.\n\n Dependencies\n\nBreeds can also have dependencies on other breeds. These dependencies should be stated explicitly, similar to how you would do in a Maven pom.xml, a Ruby Gemfile or similar package dependency systems, i.e:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.1\n\nIt is also possible to use wildcard * at the end of the name. This will match any breed name that starts with redis:1.:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.*\n\nIn a lot of cases, dependencies coexist with interpolated environment variables or constants because exact values are not known untill deploy time.  \nRead more about environment variables\n\n  \nRead about Vamp conditions\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":241},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/conditions","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Conditions","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"conditions-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nConditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.\nRead more about gateway usage. You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the /conditions endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. \n\nExample - simple inline condition\n\nThis would be used directly inside a blueprint.\n\n,condition_strength: 10%   Amount of traffic for this service in percents.\ncondition: User-Agent = IOS\n\nCreate a condition \n\nCreating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the condition field of a condition.\n\nHowever, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:\n\n| description           | syntax                       | example                  |\n| ----------------------|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| match user agent      | user-agent == value          | user-agent == Firefox    |\n| mismatch user agent   | user-agent != value          | user-agent != Firefox    |\n| match host            | host == value                | host == localhost        |\n| mismatch host         | host != value                | host != localhost       |\n| has cookie            | has cookie value             | has cookie vamp          |\n| misses cookie         | misses cookie value          | misses cookie vamp       |\n| has header            | has header value             | has header ETag          |\n| misses header         | misses header value          | misses header ETag       |\n| match cookie value    | cookie name has value    | cookie vamp has 12345    |\n| mismatch cookie value | cookie name misses value | cookie vamp misses 12345 |\n| header has value      | header name has value   | header vamp has 12345    |\n| header misses value   | header name misses value | header vamp misses 12345 |\n\nAdditional syntax examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - ConditionDefinitionParserSpec.scala.\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nIn order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between  :\n\ncondition: \" hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome \"\n\nHaving multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header\n\"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff\n\n Boolean expression in conditions\n\nVamp supports AND, OR, negation NOT and grouping ( ):\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp\n\nAdditional boolean expression examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - BooleanParserSpec.scala.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp dialects\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":242},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/deployments","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deployments","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"deployments-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nA deployment is a \"running\" blueprint with added runtime information, such as start times, resolved ports etc.\nExisting deployments can be updated, merging new blueprints or removing parts from it.

Each service can have one or multiple instances, according to its scale. In the Vamp UI you can track health of the overall deployment and individual services - read how health is reported. Each instance of a service can be accessed individually (go to the Deployments page, open the service and select an instance to view), or you can access the deployment through the exposed gateways with any applied conditions or route weights.  \nRead more about using Vamp as a reverse proxy to access deployment instances and gateways.\n\n Deployment scenarios\n\nA common Vamp deployment scenario is to introduce a new version of the service to an existing cluster, this is what we call a merge. After testing/migration is done, the old or new version can be removed from the cluster, simply called a removal. Let's look at each in turn.\n\nMerge\n\nMerging of new services is performed as a deployment update. You can merge in many ways:\n\nSend a PUT request to the /deployments/  endpoint.\nUse the UI to update a deployment using the \"Edit deployment\" button. \nUse the CLI with a combination of the vamp merge and vamp deploy commands.\n\nIf a service already exists then only the gateways and scale will be updated. Otherwise a new service will be added. If a new cluster doesn't exist in the deployment, it will be added.\n\nLet's deploy a simple service:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n     Specifying only a reference to the breed.\n    breed: monarch_1.0   \n\nAfter this point we may have another version ready for deployment and now instead of only one service, we have added another one:\n\n,name: monarch_1.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  # Some variable needed for our new recommendation engine,\n  # just as an example.\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    # Just a reference and this breed has one dependency:\n    # recommendation_1.0\n    breed: monarch_1.1\n\n  recommendation:\n    breed: recommendation_1.0\n \n\nNow our deployment (in simplified blueprint format) looks like this:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 0%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    \n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nNote that the route weight for monarch_1.1 is 0, i.e. no traffic is sent to it.\nLet's redirect some traffic to our new monarch_1.1 (e.g. 10%):\n\n,clusters:\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 90%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 10%\n\nNote that we can omit other fields like name, parameters and even other clusters (e.g. recommendation) if the change is not relevant to them. In this example we just wanted to update the weights.\n\nIn the last few examples we have shown the following:\n\nA fresh new deployment.\nA canary release with a cluster update and change of the topology (a new cluster was added).\nAn update of the gateways for a cluster - similar to a cluster scale update (instances, cpu, memory).\n\nRemoval\n\nRemoval is done using the REST API DELETE request together with the new blueprint as request body.\nIf a service exists it will be removed, otherwise the request is ignored. If a cluster has no more services left the cluster will be removed completely. Lastly, if a deployment has no more clusters it will be completely removed (destroyed).\n\nLet's use the example from the previous section. Notice the weight is evenly distributed (50/50). \n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 50%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 50%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100\n\nIf we are happy with the new monarch version 1.1, we can proceed with the removal of the old version.\nThis change is applied on the running deployment. We send the following YAML as the body of the DELETE request\nto the /deployments/deployment_UUID endpoint.\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    breed: monarch_1.0\n\nNote that this is the same original blueprint we started with. What we are doing here is basically \"subtracting\" one blueprint from the other, although \"the other\" is a running deployment.\nAfter this operation our deployment is:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 100%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nIn a nutshell: If we say that the first version was A and the second B, then we just did the migration from A to B without downtime:\nA** - A + B - A + B - A - **B\n\nWe could also remove the newer version (monarch_1.1 with/without recommendation cluster) in case that it didn't perform as we expected.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp gateways\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":243},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/dialects","date":"2017-04-03T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Dialects","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"dialects-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 90","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nA dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform.  Vamp allows you to use container driver specific tags in workflows and inside blueprints on a breed or deployment level. Dialects effectively enable you to make full use of, for instance, the underlying features like mounting disks, settings commands and providing access to private Docker registries.\n\nWe currently support the following dialects:\n\nDocker\nMarathon\n\nDocker dialect\n\nThe following example show how you can mount a volume to a Docker container using the Docker dialect.\n\n Example blueprint - using the Docker dialect\n\nname: busybox\nclusters:\n  busyboxes:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: busybox-breed\n        deployable: busybox:latest\n      dialects:\n        docker:\n          Volumes:\n            \"/tmp\": ~\n\nVamp will translate this into the proper API call. Inspecting the container after it's deployed should show something similar to this:\n\n...\n\"Volumes\":  ,\n...    \n\nMarathon dialect\n\nThis is an example with Marathon that pulls an image from private repo, mounts some volumes, sets some labels and gets run with an ad hoc command: all taken care of by Marathon.\n  \nWe can provide the dialects: tag either on the service level, cluster level or deployment level and then use the marathon tag within this. Dialects set on the service level will override the cluster level as it is more specific. However, in 9 out of 10 cases the cluster level makes the most sense. Later, you can also mix dialects so you can prep your blueprint for multiple environments and run times within one description.\n\n example blueprint - using the Marathon dialect\n\nNotice the following:\n\nUnder the marathon: tag, we provide the command to run in the container by setting the cmd: tag.\nWe provide a url to some credentials file in the uri array.

You set environment variables with the environment_variables keyword or its shorter version env, e.g. both examples below are equivalent.\n\n,environment_variables:\n  PORT: 8080\n\n,env:\n  PORT: 8080\n\n'Hard' setting a variable\n\nYou want to \"hard set\" an environment variable, just like doing an export MYVAR=somevalue in a shell. This  variable could be some external dependency you have no direct control over: the endpoint of some service you use that is out of your control. It can also be some setting you want to tweak, like JVMHEAPSIZE or AWS_REGION.\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'     \n\n Place holders\n\nPlace holders can be used to separate responsibilities across a company where different roles are working on the same project. For example, developers can create place holders for variables to be filled in by operations.\n\nUse the ~ character to define a place holder for a variable that should be filled in at runtime (i.e. when this breed actually gets deployed), but for which you do not yet know the actual value. \n\nExample - ORACLE_PASSWORD designated as a place holder\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1' \n  ORACLE_PASSWORD: ~    \n\n Resolving variables\n\nUse the $ character to reference other statements in a breed/blueprint. This allows you to dynamically resolve ports and hosts names that we don't know until a deployment is done. You can also resolve to hard coded and published constants from some other part of the blueprint or breed, typically a dependency.\n\n  \nThe $ value is escaped by $$. A more strict notation is $ \n  \n\nVamp host variable\n\nVamp provides just one magic* variable: host. This resolves to the host or ip address of the referenced service. Strictly speaking, the host reference resolves to the gateway agent endpoint, but users do not need to concern themselves with this. Users can think of one-on-one connections where Vamp actually does server-side service discovery to decouple services.\n\n Example - resolving variables from a dependency\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host        # resolves to a host at runtime\n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port  # resolves to a port at runtime\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency's environment variables\nWhat if the backend is configured through some environment variable, but the frontend also needs that information? For example, the encoding type for our database. We can just reference that environment variable using the exact same syntax.\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n      BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n    environment_variables:\n      ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'    injected into the backend MySQL container\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants (see below) allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\nEnvironment variable scope\n\nEnvironment variables can live on different scopes and can be overridden by scopes higher in the scope hierarchy.\nA scope is an area of your breed or blueprint definition that limits the visibility of variables and references inside that scope.\n\nBreed scope: The scope used in all the above examples is the default scope. If you never define any environment_variables in any other place, this will be used.\n\nCluster scope: Will override the breed scope and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override environment variables for all services that belong to a cluster.\n\nService scope: Will override breed scope and cluster scope, and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override all environment variables for a specific service within a cluster.\n\n   \nEffective use of scope is completely dependent on your use case. The various scopes help to separate concerns when multiple people and/or teams work on Vamp artifacts and deployments and need to decouple their effort.\n  \n\n Examples of scope use\n\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\nOverride the JVMHEAPSIZE in production\nUse a place holder\nJust for fun - combine all scopes and references\n\nExample 1\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\n\nUse case: As a devOps-er you want to test one service configured in two different ways at the same time. Your service is configurable using environment variables. In this case we are testing a connection pool setting. \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we just use the breed level environment variables. The traffic is split into a 50/50 divide between both services.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-a\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 30                \n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0-b               different breed name, same deployable\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            CONNECTION_POOL: 60                 # different pool size\n\n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nExample 2\nOverride the JVM_HEAP_SIZE in production\n\nUse case: As a developer, you created your service with a default heap size you use on your development laptop and maybe on a test environment. Once your service goes \"live\", an ops guy/gal should be able to override this setting.\n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we override the variable JVMHEAPSIZE for the whole frontend cluster by specifically marking it with .dot-notation cluster.variable \n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                   cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2800          # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200         # will be overridden by deployment level: 2800\n\nExample 3\nUse a place holder\n\nUse case: As a developer, you might not know some value your service needs at runtime, say the Google Anaytics ID your company uses. However, your Node.js frontend needs it! \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint the ~ place holder is used to explicitly demand that a variable is set by a higher scope. When this variable is NOT provided, Vamp will report an error at deploy time.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: 'UA-53758816-1'  # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/node_express:1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: ~               # If not provided at higher scope, \n                                                  # Vamp reports error.\n\nExample 4\nCombine all scopes and references\n\nAs a final example, let's combine some of the examples above and include referenced breeds. In this case, we have two breed artifacts already stored in Vamp and include them by using the ref keyword.\n\nIn the below blueprint:  \n\nwe override all breed scope JVMHEAPSIZE variables with cluster scope environment_variables\nto further tweak the JVMHEAPSIZE for the service frontendapp:1.0-b, we also add service scope environmentvariables for that service.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2400                    # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-a\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-b        \n        environment_variables:           \n          JVMHEAPSIZE: 1800               # overrides the breed level AND cluster level\n          \n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nConstants\n\nSometimes you just want configuration information to be available in a breed or blueprint. You don't need that information to be directly exposed as an environment variable. As a convenience, Vamp allows you to set constants.\nThese are values that cannot be changed during deploy time.\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\n Exammple - using constants\n\n,clusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n        MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n        BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n        SCHEMA: $backend.constants.SCHEMA_NAME\n      dependencies:\n        backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed:\n      name: mysql:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'\n      constants:\n        SCHEMA_NAME: 'customers'    # NOT injected into the backend MySQL container\n\n  \nRead about Vamp escalations\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":245},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/escalations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"escalations-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 110","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nAn escalation is a workflow triggered by an escalation event. Vamp checks for these escalation events using a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. If the events match the escalation handlers defined in the DSL, the action is executed.\n\nAgain: escalation events can be generated by third party systems and they will be handled in the same manner as events created by Vamp SLA workflows. \n\nEscalation handlers\n\nAny escalation that is triggered should be handled by an escalation handler\n\nVamp ships with three escalation handlers, these can be composed into intricate escalation systems: \n\nscale_instances\nscale_cpu\nscale_memory\n\n scale_instances   \nScales up the number of running instances. It is applied only to the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). You can set upper limits to how far you want to scale out or in, effectively guaranteeing a minimum set of running instances. This is very much like AWS auto-scaling. For example:\n\n,type: scale_instances\ntarget: monarch  # Target cluster for the scale up/down.\n                 # If it's not specified, by default it's the \n                 # current cluster where SLA escalations are \n                 # specified.\nminimum: 1       # Minimum number of instances.\nmaximum: 3       # Maximum number of instances.\nscale_by: 1      # Increment/decrement to use on current \n                 # number of running instances.\nscale_cpu \nScales up the number of CPUs per instances. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  For example:\n\n,type: scale_cpu\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 1\nmaximum: 3 \nscale_by: 0.5\n scale_memory   \nScales up the memory per instance. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). For example:\n\n,type: scale_memory\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 512     # In MB.\nmaximum: 4096    # In MB.\nscale_by: 512    # In MB.\n\nComposing escalation handlers\n\nVamp has a set of predefined escalation handler types that deal with escalations. You can compose these handlers in the DSL to get the desired outcome of an escalation event. The escalation handlers toall and toone are supported:\n\n to_all  \nThis is a \"group\" escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to all escalation handlers from its list. No order or hierarchy. For example: \n \n,to_all:\n  escalations:\n    # Scale up/down.\n    scale_instances\n    # And notify for each event.\n    notify\nto_one  \nThis is a group escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to each escalation handler (from its list) until one can handle it. On an Escalate event, it will start at the head of the list. During a DeEscalate event is will start at the rear.  \nWhen is this useful? Well, Vamp could try to scale up the service and if that;s not possible anymore (e.g. reached the upper limit of allowed scale) then an email can be sent.  \n\nFor example, a simple use of to_one would be: \n\n,to_one:\n  escalations:\n     First try to escalate.\n    scale_instances\n    # If it's not possible, proceed with notifying.\n    notify\nA more complex use of to_one would be: \n\n,name: monarch\n\ngateways:\n  80: monarch1/port\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  monarch2.password: secret\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch1:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch1\n      deployable: vamp/monarch1\n      ports:\n        port: 80/http\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_HOST: $storage.host\n        DB_PORT: $storage.ports.port\n        STORAGEPASS: $storage.environmentvariables.password\n      \n      dependencies:\n        storage: monarch2\n\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n    \n    sla:\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000\n        lower: 100\n      window:\n        interval: 600\n        cooldown: 600\n      escalations:\n        to_one:\n            escalations:\n              type: scale_instances\n                # First try to scale up storage service.\n                target: monarch2\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              type: scale_instances\n                # If we cannot scale up storage anymore, scale up this.\n                target: monarch1\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              \n  monarch2:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch2\n      deployable: vamp/monarch2\n      ports:\n        port: 3306\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_PASS: password\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n\n  \nRead about Vamp events\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":246},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/events","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"events-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 120","content":"\n   \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events. Vamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions. All events are stored and retrieved using the Event API that is part of Vamp.\n\nExample - JSON \"deployment create\" event\n\n \n Storing events\nVamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch with a unique ID using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .\n\nBasic event rules\n\nAll events stick to some basic rules:\n\nAll data in Vamp are events. \nEvents consist of an event type, one or more event tags and an optional event value. They are described in the format ['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type \nEvent values can be empty or any JSON object.\nEvent timestamps are in ISO8601/RFC3339.\nTimestamps are optional. If not provided, Vamp will insert the current time.\nTimestamps are inclusive for querying.\nEvents can be tagged with metadata. A simple event tag is just single string.\nQuerying data by tag assumes \"AND\" behaviour when multiple tags are supplied, i.e. [\"one\", \"two\"] would only fetch records that are tagged with both.\nSupported event aggregations are: average, min, max and count.\nYou can create custom event types, names should only include alphanumerics, ‘_’ and ‘-’\n\n Event type\nVamp works with a number of default event types and custom event types can also be created using the /events API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type event will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.\n\nDefault event types |  Description\n----------|-----,Archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)\nSynchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)\nEvent | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event\nHealth | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nMetrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nAllocation | Generated by the allocation workflow used to calculate resource usage\nWorkflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner\n\nEvent value\nThe event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If no value is specified, it will be blank\n\n Event tags\nEach event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for stored events and are used for filtering searches and listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a :. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). generictag:specifictag\n\nHow tags are organised\n\nIn all of Vamp's components we follow a REST (resource oriented) schema, for instance:\n/deployments/  \n/deployments/ /clusters/ /services/ \nTagging is done using a very similar schema: \" \", \" : \". For example:\n\n[\n    \"deployments\", \n    \"deployments: \", \n    \"clusters\", \n    \"clusters: \", \n    \"services\", \n    \"services: \"\n]\n\nThis schema allows querying per group and per specific name. Getting all events related to all deployments is done by using tag \"deployments\". Getting events for specific deployment \"deployments: \".\n\n Query events using tags\n\nUsing the tags schema and timestamps, you can do some powerful queries. Either use an exact timestamp or use special range query operators, described on the elastic.co site (elastic.co - Range query).\n\n  \nthe default page size for a set of returned events is 30.\n  \n\nExample queries\n\nGet all events\nResponse time for a cluster\nCurrent sessions for a service\nAll known events for a service\n \n Example 1\nGet all events\n\nThe below query gets ALL metrics events up till now, taking into regard the pagination.\n\n  \nGET request with body - similar to approach used by Elasticsearch.\n  \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 2 \nResponse time for a cluster\n\nThe below query gets the most recent response time events for the \"frontend\" cluster in the \"d9b42796-d8f6-431b-9230-9d316defaf6d\" deployment.\n\nNotice the \"gateways:UUID\", \"metrics:responseTime\" and \"gateways\" tags. This means \"give me the response time of this specific gateway at the gateway level\". The response will echo back the events in the time range with the original set of tags associated with the events. \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n[\n     ,\n     \n]    \n\n Example 3\nCurrent sessions for a service\n\nAnother example is getting the current sessions for a specific service, in this case the monarch_front:0.2 service that is part of the 214615ec-d5e4-473e-a98e-8aa4998b16f4 deployment and lives in the frontend cluster.\n\nNotice we made the search more specific by specifying the \"services\" and then \"service:SERVICE NAME\" tag.\nAlso, we are using relative timestamps: anything later or equal (lte) than \"now\".\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 4\nAll known events for a service\n\nThis below query gives you all the events we have for a specific service, in this case the same service as in example 2. In this way you can get a quick \"health snapshot\" of service, server, cluster or deployment.\n\nNotice we made the search less specific by just providing the \"metrics\" tag and not telling the API which specific one we want.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n Server-sent events (SSE)\n\nEvents can be streamed back directly from Vamp.\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream\n\nIn order to narrow down (filter) events, list of tags could be provided in the request body.\n\n \n\nGET method can be also used with tag parameter (may be more convenient):\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream?tag=archiving&tag=breeds\n\nArchiving\n\nAll changes in artifacts (creation, update or deletion) triggered by REST API calls are archived.

They represent load balancer rules to deployment, cluster and service instances. There are two types of Vamp gateway:\nGateways allows for programmable routing. \n\nInternal gateways created automatically for each deployment cluster and shared by all services deployed within it. Used to distribute traffic for canary releasing and A/B testing across service variants.\nExternal gateways  explicitly declared either in a deployment blueprint or using the gateways API. Provide a stable entry point to a defined, existing route or routes.\n\nEach gateway defines a set of rules for filtering and distributing traffic across the included routes and can optionally be set as sticky. You can access internal and external gateways through Vamp reverse proxy.\n\nOn this page:\n\nRoute weight and condition strength\nURL path rewrite\nVamp managed and external routes\n\n Route weight and condition strength\n\nEach route in a gateway has a weight and optionally one or more conditions with a condition_strength (used to target specific traffic for routing). Read more about conditions  \n\nRouting is calculated as followed:\n\nVamp will first check for a condition that matches the incoming request.   \n  for example, IOS users\nIf a matching condition is found, Vamp will check the condition_strength. The condition strength specifies the percentage of traffic matching the condition to target.  \n  for example, 10% of IOS\nFinally, if no matching condition was found or the request was not selected for routing based on the conditionstrength, it will be routed according to the route weight of all available routes.    \n  for example, all non-IOS traffic and 90% of IOS users are routed according to route weight\n\n  \nVamp has to account for all traffic.  \nWhen defining weights, the total weight of all routes must always add up to 100%.\nThis means that in a straight three-way split one service must be given 34% as 33%+33%+33%=99% - 1% can be a lot of traffic in high volume environments.\n  \n\nExample - Route all Firefox and only Firefox users to route service_B:\n\nservice_A:\n  weight: 100%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 0%\n  condition_strength: 100%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\n Example - Route half of Firefox users to serviceB, other half to serviceA (80%) or service_B (20%):\nNon Firefox requests will be just sent to serviceA (80%) or serviceB (20%).\nservice_A:\n  weight: 80%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 20%\n  condition_strength: 50%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\nExample - A/B test two deployments using route weight\nBelow is a basic example, similar to putting both deployments (sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0) in the same cluster.  \nIt is easy to imagine having an older legacy application and the new one and doing a full canary release (or A/B testing) in seamless way by using gateways like this.\n\nDeployment 1: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.0\n\nname: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.0.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nDeployment 2: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.1\n\nname: sava:1.1\ngateways:\n  9060/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.1.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nGateway (90% / 10%): POST /api/v1/gateways\n\nname: sava\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  sava:1.0/sava/port:\n    weight: 90%           condition can be used as well\n  sava:1.1/sava/port:\n    weight: 10%\n\nURL path rewrite\n\nVamp supports URL path rewrite. This can be a powerful solution in defining service APIs (e.g. RESTful) outside of application service.  Path rewrite is defined in the format path: NEW_PATH if CONDITION, where:\n\nNEW_PATH new path to be used; HAProxy variables are supported, e.g. %[path]\nCONDITION condition using HAProxy directives, e.g. matching path, method, headers etc.\n\n Example\nroutes:\n  web/port1:\n    rewrites:\n    path: a if b\n  web/port2:\n    weight: 100%\n\nVamp managed and external routes\n\nVamp managed routes are in the format:\n\ngateway - pointing to another gateway, e.g. it is possible to chain gateways\ndeployment/cluster - pointing to deployment cluster, i.e. services are not 'visible'\ndeployment/cluster/service - pointing to specific service within deployment cluster\n\nAll examples above cover only Vamp managed routes.\nIt is also possible to route traffic to specific IP or hostname and port.\nIn that case IP or hostname and port need to be specified between brackets, e.g. [hostname:port] (and double quotes due to Yaml syntax).\n\nname: mesos\nport: 8080/http\nsticky: route\n\nroutes:\n  \"[192.168.99.100:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n  \"[localhost:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n\n  \nRead about Vamp workflows\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":248},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/health","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Health","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"health-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 130","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nVamp tracks the health of deployed service instances and gateways. The default Vamp health workflow reports health based on a combination of defined health checks and gateway monitoring. Health status is stored in the Elasticsearch index vamp-pulse-health-YYYY-MM-DD and displayed in the Vamp UI. It can also be retrieved directly using the Vamp API health endpoint.\n\nCustom health checks\n\nCustom health checks can be added on a service, cluster or breed level:\n\n Service level health checks\nDefined in a blueprint and applied to all instances of a service. Service level health checks override all health checks defined on a breed or cluster level. For example, including an empty health check specification for a service  (healthchecks: []) will cause all cluster and breed level health checks to be skipped for this service.\n\nCluster level health checks\nDefined in a blueprint and applied to all services within the cluster (unless overridden by a health check defined on a service level). Cluster level health checks override breed level health checks. \n\n Breed level health checks\nDefined in a breed (an individual artifact, or inline as part of a blueprint). Applied to all instances of the breed, unless overridden by health checks defined on the service or cluster level.\n\nDefining health checks\n \nA health check definition contains the following fields (fields with a default value are optional):\n\nfield  |  default   |   description\n----|----|-,protocol  |  HTTP  |  protocol for health check requests (HTTP or HTTPS)\npath  |  /   |  path for health check requests (string value)\ninitial_delay  |  - |  delay before initial health check request (time value *)\nport   |  -  |  port for health check requests (string value referencing a defined port)\ntimeout   |  -  |   how long a request can timeout before counting the request as a failure (time value *)\ninterval   |  -  |   interval between health check requests (time value *)\nfailures    |  -  |   maximum amount of failures before service is restarted due to being unhealthy (numerical value)\n\n*) Note that time value must be specified in lower case:\n\ns|sec|second|seconds\nm|min|minute|minutes\nh|hrs|hour|hour\n\n Example: Single health check\nPath in this example evaluates to / and protocol to HTTP.\n\n,name: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: sava/webport\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: sava:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          webport: 8080/http\n      scale:\n        cpu: 0.2\n        memory: 64MB\n        instances: 1\n      health_checks:\n        initial_delay: 10s\n        port: webport\n        timeout: 5s\n        interval: 10s\n        failures: 10\nExample: Multiple health checks\n\n health_checks:\n  initial_delay: 10s\n     port: webport\n     timeout: 5s\n     interval: 10s\n     failures: 10\n     protocol: HTTPS\n  initial_delay: 1m\n     port: webport\n     path: /test\n     timeout: 10s\n     interval: 1m\n     failures: 5\n     protocol: HTTPS \n\n  \nRead about Referencing artifacts in Vamp\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":249},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/references","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Referencing artifacts","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"referencing-artifacts-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 140","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nWith any artifact, Vamp allows you to either use an inline notation or reference the artifact by name. For references, you use the reference keyword or its shorter version ref. Think of it like either using actual values or pointers to a value. This has a big impact on how complex or simple you can make any blueprint, breed or deployment. It also impacts how much knowledge you need to have of all the different artifacts that are used in a typical deployment or blueprint.\n\nVamp assumes that referenced artifcats (the breed called my_breed in the example below) is available to load from its datastore at deploy time. This goes for all basic artifacts in Vamp: SLA's, gateways, conditions, escalations, etc.\n\nExample - reference notation\n\ninline notation\n\nname: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          name: my_breed\n          deployable: registry.example.com/app:1.0\n        scale:\n          cpu: 2\n          memory: 1024MB\n          instances: 4\nreference notation\n\nname: my_blueprint\n  clusters:\n    my_cluster:\n      services:\n        breed:\n          reference: my_breed\n        scale:\n          reference: medium  \n\n Working with references\n\nWhen you begin to work with Vamp, you will probably start with inline artifacts. You have everything in one place and can directly see what properties each artifact has. Later, you can start specialising and basically build a library of often used architectural components. \n\nExample use of references\n\nCreate a library of containers\nFix scales per environment\nReuse a complex condition\n\n Example 1 \nCreate a library of containers\n\nUse case: You have a Redis container you have tweaked and setup exactly the way you want it. You want to use that exact container in all your environments (dev, test, prod etc.). \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a breed and use either the Vamp UI or API to save it (below).

For instance, a \"mediumproduction\" should be something else than a \"mediumtest\".\n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a scale and use either the Vamp API to save it (below). Now you can use the ref: mediumtest or ref: mediumprod notation anywhere a scale type is required.\n\nPOST /api/v1/scales\n\nname: medium_prod\ncpu: 2\nmemory: 4096MB\ninstances: 3\n\nname: medium_test\ncpu: 0.5\nmemory: 1024MB\ninstances: 1\n\n Example 3\nReuse a complex condition\n\nUse case: You have created a complex condition to target a specific part of your traffic. In this case users with a cookie that have a specific session variable set in that cookie. You want to use that condition now and then to do some testing. \n\nImplementation: Put all that info inside a condition and use either the Vamp API to save it (below).

In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry (microservices.io - service registry).\n\nFor Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:\n\nNo code injection needed.\nNo extra libraries or agents needed.\nplatform/language agnostic: it’s just HTTP.\nEasy integration using ENV variables.\n\nCreate and publish a service\n\n  \nServices do not register themselves. They are explicitly created, registered in the Vamp database and provisioned on the load balancer.\n  \n\nServices are created and published as follows:\n\nThe user describes a service and its desired endpoint port in the Vamp DSL.\nThe service is deployed to the configured container manager by Vamp.\nVamp instructs Vamp Gateway Agent (via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul) to set up service endpoints.\nVamp Gateway Agent takes care of configuring HAProxy, making the services available.\n\nAfter this, you can scale the service up/down or in/out either by hand or using Vamp’s auto scaling functionality. The endpoint is stable.\n\n Discovering a service\n\nSo, how does one service find a dependent service? Services are found by just referencing them in the DSL. Take a look at the following example:\n\nname: my_blueprint:1.0\nclusters:\n  myfrontendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: myfrontendservice:0.1\n        deployable: company/frontend:0.1\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        dependencies:\n          backend: mybackendservice:0.3\n        environment_variables:\n         BACKEND_HOST: $backend.host\n         BACKEND_PORT: $backend.ports.jdbc\n      scale:\n        instances: 3         \n  mybackendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: mybackendservice:0.3\n        deployable: company/backend:0.3\n        ports:\n          jdbc: 8080/tcp\n      scale:\n        instances: 4\n\nWe have a frontend cluster and a backend cluster. These are just organisational units.\nThe frontend cluster runs just one version of our service, consisting of three instances.\nThe frontend service has a hard dependency on a backend (tcp) service.\nWe reference the backend by name, my_backend:0.3, and assign it a label, in this case just backend\nWe use the label backend to get the host and a specific port (jdbc) from this backend.\nWe assign these values to environment variables that are exposed in the container runtime.\nAny frontend service now has access to the location of the dependent backend service.\n\nNote that there is no point-to-point wiring. The $backend.host and $backend.ports.jdbc variables resolve to service endpoints Vamp automatically sets up and exposes.\n\nEven though Vamp provides this type of service discovery, it does not put any constraint on other possible solutions. For instance services can use their own approach specific approach using service registry, self-registration etc.\n\nConfigure the gateway-driver\n\nThe gateway-driver section of the Vamp configuration file application.conf configures how traffic should be routed through Vamp Gateway Agent. See the below example on how to configure this:\n\nvamp  \n     \n   \n   \n\nThe reason for the need to configure vamp.gateway-driver.host is that when services are deployed, they need to be able to find Vamp Gateway Agent in their respective networks. This can be a totally different network than where Vamp is running.\nLet's use an example: frontend and backend service, frontend depends on backend - in Vamp DSL that would be 2 clusters (assuming the same deployment).\nThere are different ways how frontend can discover its dependency backend, and to make things simpler Vamp supports using specific environment parameters.\n\nname: my-web-app\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-frontend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-frontend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.port\n        dependencies:\n          backend: my-backend:1.0.0\n  backend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-backend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-backend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n\nIn this example $backend.host will have the value of the vamp.gateway-driver.host configuration parameter, while $backend.ports.port the next available port from vamp.operation.gateway.port-range.\nfrontend doesn't connect to backend directly but via Vamp Gateway Agent(s) - given on these host and port parameters.\nThis is quite simmilar to common pattern to access any clustered application.\nFor instance if you want to access DB server, you will have an address string based on e.g. DNS name or something simmilar.\nNote that even without Vamp, you would need to setup access to backend in some similar way.\nWith Vamp, access is via VGA's and that allows specific routing (conditions, weights) needed for A/B testing and canary releasing.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp SLAs (Service Level Agreements)\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":252},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.4/sla","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"SLA (Service Level Agreement)","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"sla-v094\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 160","content":"\n  \n\nSwitch to the latest version of this page.\nRead the release notes for the latest Vamp release.\n  \n\nSLA stands for \"Service Level Agreement\". Vamp uses it to define a pre-described set of boundaries to a service and the actions that should take place once the service crosses those boundaries. In essence, an SLA and its associated escalation is a workflow that is checked and controlled by Vamp based on the runtime behaviour of a service. SLAs and escalations are defined with the VAMP DSL.\n\nThe SLA event system\n\nYou can define an SLA for each cluster in a blueprint. A common example would be to check if the average response time of the cluster (averaged across all services) is higher or lower than a certain threshold. Under the hood, an SLA workflow creates two distinct events. These are are sent from Vamp and stored to Elasticsearch.\n\nEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is higher than the upper threshold.\nDeEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is lower than the lower threshold.\n\nSLA monitoring is a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. On each run an SLA workflow is executed for each deployment & cluster that has an SLA defined. Within the same SLA definition it's possible to define a list of escalations. Escalations are triggered by escalation events (Escalate/DeEscalate).\n\nThis means escalation events can be generated by the third party systems by sending them to Elasticsearch. This would allow scaling up or down to be triggered by basically any system that can POST a piece of JSON.\n\nSLA's are in essence pieces of code inside Vamp that stick to this event model and can use, if they want, the metrics and event data streaming out of Elasticsearch to make decisions on how things are and should be running.\n\n SLA types\n\nVamp currently ships with the following SLA types:\n\nresponsetimesliding_window\n\nResponse time with sliding window \n\nThe responsetimesliding_window SLA triggers events based on response times. \n\n Example - SLA defined inline in a blueprint.\n\nNotice the SLA is defined per cluster and acts on the first service in the cluster.\n\nNotice how the SLA is defined separately from the escalations. This is key to how Vamp approaches SLA's and how modular and extendable the system is.\n\nname: sava\n\ngateways:\n  80: sava/webport\n\nclusters:\n\n  sava:                        # the sava cluster\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: monarch\n        deployable: vamp/monarch\n        ports:\n          webport: 80\n\n      scale:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1024MB\n        instances: 2\n\n    sla:                        # SLA applies to the first service in the sava cluster (monarch)\n      # Type of SLA.\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000   # Upper threshold in milliseconds.\n        lower: 100    # Lower threshold in milliseconds.\n      window:\n        interval: 600 # Time period in seconds used for\n                      # average response time aggregation.\n        cooldown: 600 # Time period in seconds.

JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. Workflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times. \n\nVamp ships with four default workflows:\n\nHealth  - checks and stores the status of running services. Events stored by the health workflow are used by the Vamp UI.\nMetrics - stores metrics on running services. Events stored by the metrics workflow are used by the Vamp UI.\nKibana - supports the easy creation of Kibana dashboards.\nAllocation - calculates resource usage (CPU, memory)\n\n  \nThe following breeds are required by system workflows and should not be deleted: allocation, health, kibana, metrics, vamp-workflow-javascript\n  \n\nOn this page:\nTrack running workflows\nCreate a workflow\n  Workflow schedules\n  Workflow dialects\nJavaScript workflows\n\n Track running workflows\n\nYou can track executions of a running workflow in the Vamp UI. From the Workflows page, click on a workflow port to open the execution list. Click on a specific execution to open its log.\n\nCreate a workflow\n\nWorkflows can be created using Node JS based scripts running inside a Vamp workflow agent container, or use another language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a Docker container to be deployed by Vamp.  \nVamp tracks all revisions made to workflows and breeds, so you can check back and compare the current version against a previous version.\n\nTry it yourself: Create a workflow that generates events\n\n Workflow schedules\n\nYou can schedule a workflow to run as a daemon, be triggered by specific events or run according to a time schedule. See the examples for each below.\n\nScheduled as a daemon  \nA workflow scheduled as a daemon will run continuously.\n\n    schedule: daemon\n  \nTriggered by events  \n\nschedule:\n  event: # event with following tags will trigger the workflow\n  deployments:sava\n  cluster:runner\n\nschedule:  # shortened notation in case of single event (still array can be used as above)\n  event: archive:bluprints\n\nScheduled by time  \nperiod, start (optional, by default starts now) and repeat (optional, by default runs forever). The time schedule period is in ISO8601 repeating interval notation.   \n  For example:  \n\nschedule:\n  time:\n    period: P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S\n    start: now # or e.g. start: 2016-12-03T08:15:30Z\n    repeat: 10\n\nWorkflow dialects\nYou can use dialects to specify native commands for the underlying container platform in a workflow.  \nRead more about Vamp dialects\n\n JavaScript workflows\nJavaScript workflows are executed by Vamp Workflow Agent (github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent).  The system breed vamp-workflow-javascript is used to apply the standard enviroment variables, health checks and exposed ports.   \nInstructions for using JavaScript to access the Vamp API can be found in the Vamp Node Client project (github.com/magneticio - Vamp node client).\n\nExample: Metrics workflow and breed\nThe below examples show a JavaScript workflow with a separately stored JavaScript breed.

This means you reference your breeds (or define them inline) and add runtime configuration to them. Blueprints can be created and edited using the Vamp Domain Specific Language (DSL). Vamp tracks all revisions made to artifacts, so you can check back and compare the current blueprint against a previous version.\n\nDocker compose\n\nThe Vamp UI includes a handy tool to import Docker Compose files and convert these into the Vamp DSL format for deployment in Vamp. Note that some fields may need manual adjustment after conversion (see comments attached to the generated blueprint for details). \n\n Blueprint artifacts\n\nBlueprints allow you to specify the following properties:\n\nGateways: a stable port where the service can be reached.\nClusters and services: a cluster is a grouping of services with one purpose, i.e. two versions (a/b) of one service.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nDialects: a dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform, i.e. Docker or Mesosphere Marathon.\nScale: the CPU and memory and the amount of instance allocate to a service.\nConditions: how traffic should be directed based on HTTP and/or TCP properties.\nSLA and escalations: SLA definition that controls autoscaling.\nHealth: The health checks to be applied to a service, cluster or breed.\n\nExample - key concepts of blueprints\n\n,name: my_blueprint                         Custom blueprint name\ngateways:\n  8080/http: my_frontend/port\nclusters:\n  my_frontend:                            # Custom cluster name.\n  \n    gateways:                             # Gateway for this cluster services.\n      routes:                             # Makes sense only with\n        somecoolbreed:                  # multiple services per cluster.\n          weight: 95%\n          condition: User-Agent = Chrome\n        someotherbreed:                 # Second service.\n          weight: 5%\n          \n    services:                             # List of services\n      breed:\n          ref: somecoolbreed\n        scale:                            # Scale for this service.\n          cpu: 2                          # Number of CPUs per instance.\n          memory: 2048MB                  # Memory per instance (MB/GB units).\n          instances: 2                    # Number of instances\n      breed: \n          ref: someotherbreed           # Another service in the same cluster.  \n        scale: large                      # Notice we used a reference to a \"scale\". \n                                          # More on this later.\n\nGateways\n\nA gateway is a \"stable\" endpoint (or port in simplified sense) that almost never changes. When creating the mapping, it uses the definition (my_frontend/port in this case) from the \"first\" service in the cluster definition you reference. This service can of course be changed, but the gateway port normally doesn't.\n\nPlease take care of setting the /tcp or /http (default) type for the port. Using /http allows Vamp to record more relevant metrics like response times and metrics.\n\nRead more about gateways.\n\n  \ngateways are optional. You can just deploy services and have a home grown method to connect them to some stable, exposable endpoint.\n  \n\n Clusters and services\n\nIn essence, blueprints define a collection of clusters.\nA cluster is a group of different services, which will appear as a single service and serve a single purpose.\n\nCommon use cases would be service A and B in an A/B testing scenario - usually just different\nversions of the same service (e.g. canary release or blue/green deployment).\n\nClusters are configured by defining an array of services. A cluster can be given an arbitrary name. Services are just lists or arrays of breeds.\n\n,mycoolcluster\n  services\n   breed: \n      ref: mycoolservice_A      # reference to an existing breed\n   breed:                       # shortened inline breed\n       name: mycoolservice_B\n       deployable: some_container\n       ...\n\nClusters and services are just organisational items. Vamp uses them to order, reference and control the actual containers and gateways and traffic.\n\n This all seems redundant, right? We have a reference chain of blueprints - gateways - clusters - services - breeds - deployable. However, you need this level of control and granularity in any serious environment where DRY principles are taken seriously and where \"one size fits all\" doesn't fly.\n\nScale\n\nScale is the \"size\" of a deployed service. Usually that means the number of instances (servers) and allocated CPU and memory.\n\nScales can be defined inline in a blueprint or they can defined separately and given a unique name. The following example is a scale named \"small\". POST-ing this scale to the /scales REST API endpoint will store it under that name so it can be referenced from other blueprints.\n\n Example scale\n\n,name: small   # Custom name.\n\ncpu: 2        # Number of CPUs per instance.\nmemory: 2gb   # Memory per instance, MB/GB units.\ninstances: 2  # Number of instances.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp breeds\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":258},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/breeds","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Breeds","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"breeds-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 60","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nBreeds are static descriptions of applications and services available for deployment. Each breed is described by the DSL in YAML notation or JSON, whatever you like. This description includes name, version, available parameters, dependencies etc.\nTo a certain degree, you could compare a breed to a Maven artifact or a Ruby Gem description.  \nVamp tracks all revisions made to artifacts, so you can check back and compare a current breed against a previous version.\n\nBreeds allow you to set the following properties:\n\nDeployable: the name of actual container or command that should be run.\nPorts: a map of ports your container exposes.\nDependencies: a list of other breeds this breed depends on.\nEnvironment variables: a list of variables (interpolated or not) to be made available at runtime.\nHealth checks: a list of health checks to perform on this breed (note that these will be overridden by health checks defined on the service or cluster level)\n\n  \nThe breeds listed below are required by system workflows and should not be deleted:\n\nallocation\nhealth\nkibana\nmetrics\nvamp-workflow-javascript\n  \n\nDeployable\n\nDeployables are pointers to the actual artifacts that get deployed. Vamp supports Docker containers or can support any other artifacts supported by your container manager. \n\n Example breed - deploy a Docker container\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http   \n\nThis breed, with a unique name, describes a deployable and the port it works on. \n\nDocker deployables\n\nDocker images are pulled by your container manager from any of the repositories configured. By default that would be the public Docker hub, but it could also be a private repo.\nThe default deployable type is a Docker container, but we could also make this explicit by setting type to docker. The following statements are equivalent:\n\n,deployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\n,deployable: \n  type: container/docker\n  definition: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nThis shows the full (expanded) deployable with type and definition.\n\n JavaScript deployables \n\nBreeds can have type application/javascript and definition should be a JavaScript script:\n\n,name: hello-world\ndeployable:\n  type: application/javascript\n  definition: |\n    console.log('Hello World Vamp!');\n\nIt is possible to create or update breeds with the API request POST|PUT /api/v1/breeds/ , Javascript script as body and header Content-Type: application/javascript.\n\nOther deployable types\n\nRunning \"other\" artifacts such as zips or jars heavily depends on the underlying container manager.\nWhen Vamp is set up to run with Marathon (mesosphere.github.io - Marathon), command (or cmd) deployable types can be used.\nIn that case cmd (Marathon REST API - post v2/apps) parameter will have value of deployable.\n\n Example breed - run a custom jar after it has been downloaded \nCombining this definition and the Vamp Marathon dialect  uris parameter allows the requested jar to be downloaded from a remote location (Marathon REST API - uris Array of Strings). \n\n,name: location\nclusters:\n  api:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: location\n        deployable: \n          type: cmd\n          definition: java -jar location.jar\n      marathon:\n        uris: [\"https://myrepolocation_jar\"]\n\nPorts\n\nThe ports property is an array of named ports together with their protocol. It describes on what ports the deployables is offering services to the outside world. Let's look at the following breed:\n\n,name: my_breed:0.1\ndeployable: company/myfrontendservice:0.1\n\nports:\n  web: 8080/http\n  admin: 8081/http\n  redis: 9023/tcp   \n\nPorts come in two flavors:\n\n/http HTTP ports are the default type if none is specified. They are always recommended when dealing with HTTP-based services. Vamp can record a lot of interesting metrics like response times, errors etc. Of course, using /tcp will work but you miss out on cool data.\n/tcp Use TCP ports for things like Redis, MySQL etc.\n\n  \n/http notation for ports is required for use of filters.\n  \n\nNotice we can give the ports sensible names. This specific deployable has web port for customer traffic, an admin port for admin access and a redis port for some caching probably. These names come in handy when we later compose different breeds in blueprints.\n\n Dependencies\n\nBreeds can also have dependencies on other breeds. These dependencies should be stated explicitly, similar to how you would do in a Maven pom.xml, a Ruby Gemfile or similar package dependency systems, i.e:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.1\n\nIt is also possible to use wildcard * at the end of the name. This will match any breed name that starts with redis:1.:\n\n,dependencies:\n  cache: redis:1.*\n\nIn a lot of cases, dependencies coexist with interpolated environment variables or constants because exact values are not known untill deploy time.  \nRead more about environment variables\n\n  \nRead about Vamp conditions\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":259},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/conditions","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Conditions","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"conditions-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 80","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nConditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.\nRead more about gateway usage. You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the /conditions endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. \n\nExample - simple inline condition\n\nThis would be used directly inside a blueprint.\n\n,condition_strength: 10%   Amount of traffic for this service in percents.\ncondition: User-Agent = IOS\n\nCreate a condition \n\nCreating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.\nUnder the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's (cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the condition field of a condition.\n\nHowever, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient \"short codes\"\nto address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:\n\n| description           | syntax                       | example                  |\n| ----------------------|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| match user agent      | user-agent == value          | user-agent == Firefox    |\n| mismatch user agent   | user-agent != value          | user-agent != Firefox    |\n| match host            | host == value                | host == localhost        |\n| mismatch host         | host != value                | host != localhost       |\n| has cookie            | has cookie value             | has cookie vamp          |\n| misses cookie         | misses cookie value          | misses cookie vamp       |\n| has header            | has header value             | has header ETag          |\n| misses header         | misses header value          | misses header ETag       |\n| match cookie value    | cookie name has value    | cookie vamp has 12345    |\n| mismatch cookie value | cookie name misses value | cookie vamp misses 12345 |\n| header has value      | header name has value   | header vamp has 12345    |\n| header misses value   | header name misses value | header vamp misses 12345 |\n\nAdditional syntax examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - ConditionDefinitionParserSpec.scala.\n\nVamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:\n\nIn order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between  :\n\ncondition: \" hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome \"\n\nHaving multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string \"Chrome\" exists in the User-Agent header of a\nrequest and then it would check whether the request has the header\n\"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: \"User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER\"\n\nUsing a tool like httpie (github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.\n\n    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff\n\n Boolean expression in conditions\n\nVamp supports AND, OR, negation NOT and grouping ( ):\n\n,gateways:\n  weight: 100%\n  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp\n\nAdditional boolean expression examples: github.com/magneticio/vamp - BooleanParserSpec.scala.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp dialects\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n\n","id":260},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/deployments","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Deployments","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"deployments-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 20","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nA deployment is a \"running\" blueprint with added runtime information, such as start times, resolved ports etc.\nExisting deployments can be updated, merging new blueprints or removing parts from it.

Each service can have one or multiple instances, according to its scale. In the Vamp UI you can track health of the overall deployment and individual services - read how health is reported. Each instance of a service can be accessed individually (go to the Deployments page, open the service and select an instance to view), or you can access the deployment through the exposed gateways with any applied conditions or route weights.  \nRead more about using Vamp as a reverse proxy to access deployment instances and gateways.\n\n Deployment scenarios\n\nA common Vamp deployment scenario is to introduce a new version of the service to an existing cluster, this is what we call a merge. After testing/migration is done, the old or new version can be removed from the cluster, simply called a removal. Let's look at each in turn.\n\nMerge\n\nMerging of new services is performed as a deployment update. You can merge in many ways:\n\nSend a PUT request to the /deployments/  endpoint.\nUse the UI to update a deployment using the \"Edit deployment\" button. \nUse the CLI with a combination of the vamp merge and vamp deploy commands.\n\nIf a service already exists then only the gateways and scale will be updated. Otherwise a new service will be added. If a new cluster doesn't exist in the deployment, it will be added.\n\nLet's deploy a simple service:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n     Specifying only a reference to the breed.\n    breed: monarch_1.0   \n\nAfter this point we may have another version ready for deployment and now instead of only one service, we have added another one:\n\n,name: monarch_1.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  # Some variable needed for our new recommendation engine,\n  # just as an example.\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    # Just a reference and this breed has one dependency:\n    # recommendation_1.0\n    breed: monarch_1.1\n\n  recommendation:\n    breed: recommendation_1.0\n \n\nNow our deployment (in simplified blueprint format) looks like this:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 0%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    \n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nNote that the route weight for monarch_1.1 is 0, i.e. no traffic is sent to it.\nLet's redirect some traffic to our new monarch_1.1 (e.g. 10%):\n\n,clusters:\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 90%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 10%\n\nNote that we can omit other fields like name, parameters and even other clusters (e.g. recommendation) if the change is not relevant to them. In this example we just wanted to update the weights.\n\nIn the last few examples we have shown the following:\n\nA fresh new deployment.\nA canary release with a cluster update and change of the topology (a new cluster was added).\nAn update of the gateways for a cluster - similar to a cluster scale update (instances, cpu, memory).\n\nRemoval\n\nRemoval is done using the REST API DELETE request together with the new blueprint as request body.\nIf a service exists it will be removed, otherwise the request is ignored. If a cluster has no more services left the cluster will be removed completely. Lastly, if a deployment has no more clusters it will be completely removed (destroyed).\n\nLet's use the example from the previous section. Notice the weight is evenly distributed (50/50). \n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.0\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n          \n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.0:\n        weight: 50%\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 50%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100\n\nIf we are happy with the new monarch version 1.1, we can proceed with the removal of the old version.\nThis change is applied on the running deployment. We send the following YAML as the body of the DELETE request\nto the /deployments/deployment_UUID endpoint.\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nclusters:\n  monarch:\n    breed: monarch_1.0\n\nNote that this is the same original blueprint we started with. What we are doing here is basically \"subtracting\" one blueprint from the other, although \"the other\" is a running deployment.\nAfter this operation our deployment is:\n\n,name: monarch_1.0\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  recommendation.route: \"/api/v1\"\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch:\n    services:\n      breed: monarch_1.1\n    gateways:\n      monarch_1.1:\n        weight: 100%\n\n  recommendation:\n    services:\n      breed: recommendation_1.0\n    gateways:\n      recommendation_1.0:\n        weight: 100%\n\nIn a nutshell: If we say that the first version was A and the second B, then we just did the migration from A to B without downtime:\nA** - A + B - A + B - A - **B\n\nWe could also remove the newer version (monarch_1.1 with/without recommendation cluster) in case that it didn't perform as we expected.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp gateways\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":261},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/dialects","date":"2017-04-03T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Dialects","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"dialects-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 90","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nA dialect is a set of native commands for the underlying container platform.  Vamp allows you to use container driver specific tags in workflows and inside blueprints on a breed or deployment level.

Dialects set on the service level will override the cluster level as it is more specific. However, in 9 out of 10 cases the cluster level makes the most sense. Later, you can also mix dialects so you can prep your blueprint for multiple environments and run times within one description.\n\n example blueprint - using the Marathon dialect\n\nNotice the following:\n\nUnder the marathon: tag, we provide the command to run in the container by setting the cmd: tag.\nWe provide a url to some credentials file in the uri array.

This  variable could be some external dependency you have no direct control over: the endpoint of some service you use that is out of your control. It can also be some setting you want to tweak, like JVMHEAPSIZE or AWS_REGION.\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'     \n\n Place holders\n\nPlace holders can be used to separate responsibilities across a company where different roles are working on the same project. For example, developers can create place holders for variables to be filled in by operations.\n\nUse the ~ character to define a place holder for a variable that should be filled in at runtime (i.e. when this breed actually gets deployed), but for which you do not yet know the actual value. \n\nExample - ORACLE_PASSWORD designated as a place holder\n\n,name: javaawsapp:1.2.1\ndeployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1\nenvironment_variables:\n  JVMHEAPSIZE: 1200\n  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1' \n  ORACLE_PASSWORD: ~    \n\n Resolving variables\n\nUse the $ character to reference other statements in a breed/blueprint. This allows you to dynamically resolve ports and hosts names that we don't know until a deployment is done. You can also resolve to hard coded and published constants from some other part of the blueprint or breed, typically a dependency.\n\n  \nThe $ value is escaped by $$. A more strict notation is $ \n  \n\nVamp host variable\n\nVamp provides just one magic* variable: host. This resolves to the host or ip address of the referenced service. Strictly speaking, the host reference resolves to the gateway agent endpoint, but users do not need to concern themselves with this. Users can think of one-on-one connections where Vamp actually does server-side service discovery to decouple services.\n\n Example - resolving variables from a dependency\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host        # resolves to a host at runtime\n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port  # resolves to a port at runtime\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n\nExample - resolving variables from a dependency's environment variables\nWhat if the backend is configured through some environment variable, but the frontend also needs that information? For example, the encoding type for our database. We can just reference that environment variable using the exact same syntax.\n\n,name: blueprint1\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      deployable: acmecorp/tomcat:1.2.1      \n    environment_variables:\n      MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n      MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n      BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n    dependencies:\n      backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed: mysql:1.0\n    environment_variables:\n      ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'    injected into the backend MySQL container\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants (see below) allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\nEnvironment variable scope\n\nEnvironment variables can live on different scopes and can be overridden by scopes higher in the scope hierarchy.\nA scope is an area of your breed or blueprint definition that limits the visibility of variables and references inside that scope.\n\nBreed scope: The scope used in all the above examples is the default scope. If you never define any environment_variables in any other place, this will be used.\n\nCluster scope: Will override the breed scope and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override environment variables for all services that belong to a cluster.\n\nService scope: Will override breed scope and cluster scope, and is part of the blueprint artifact. Use this to override all environment variables for a specific service within a cluster.\n\n   \nEffective use of scope is completely dependent on your use case. The various scopes help to separate concerns when multiple people and/or teams work on Vamp artifacts and deployments and need to decouple their effort.\n  \n\n Examples of scope use\n\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\nOverride the JVMHEAPSIZE in production\nUse a place holder\nJust for fun - combine all scopes and references\n\nExample 1\nRun two of the same services with different configurations\n\nUse case: As a devOps-er you want to test one service configured in two different ways at the same time. Your service is configurable using environment variables. In this case we are testing a connection pool setting. \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint we just use the breed level environment variables.

However, your Node.js frontend needs it! \n\nImplementation: In the below blueprint the ~ place holder is used to explicitly demand that a variable is set by a higher scope. When this variable is NOT provided, Vamp will report an error at deploy time.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: 'UA-53758816-1'  # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: frontend_app:1.0\n          deployable: acmecorp/node_express:1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n          environment_variables:           \n            GOOGLEANALYTICSKEY: ~               # If not provided at higher scope, \n                                                  # Vamp reports error.\n\nExample 4\nCombine all scopes and references\n\nAs a final example, let's combine some of the examples above and include referenced breeds. In this case, we have two breed artifacts already stored in Vamp and include them by using the ref keyword.\n\nIn the below blueprint:  \n\nwe override all breed scope JVMHEAPSIZE variables with cluster scope environment_variables\nto further tweak the JVMHEAPSIZE for the service frontendapp:1.0-b, we also add service scope environmentvariables for that service.\n\n,name: production_deployment:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050: frontend/port\nenvironment_variables:                             cluster level variable \n  frontend.JVMHEAPSIZE: 2400                    # overrides the breed level\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-a\n      breed:\n          ref: frontend_app:1.0-b        \n        environment_variables:           \n          JVMHEAPSIZE: 1800               # overrides the breed level AND cluster level\n          \n  gateways:\n    frontend_app:1.0-a:\n      weight: 50% \n    frontend_app:1.0-b:\n      weight: 50% \n\nConstants\n\nSometimes you just want configuration information to be available in a breed or blueprint. You don't need that information to be directly exposed as an environment variable. As a convenience, Vamp allows you to set constants.\nThese are values that cannot be changed during deploy time.\n\nYou can do everything with environment_variables but constants allow you to just be a little bit cleaner with regard to what you want to expose and what not.\n\n Exammple - using constants\n\n,clusters:\n  frontend:\n    breed:\n      name: frontend_app:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        MYSQL_HOST: $backend.host       \n        MYSQL_PORT: $backend.ports.port \n        BACKENDENCODING: $backend.environmentvariables.ENCODING_TYPE\n        SCHEMA: $backend.constants.SCHEMA_NAME\n      dependencies:\n        backend: mysql:1.0\n  backend:\n    breed:\n      name: mysql:1.0\n      environment_variables:\n        ENCODING_TYPE: 'UTF8'\n      constants:\n        SCHEMA_NAME: 'customers'    # NOT injected into the backend MySQL container\n\n  \nRead about Vamp escalations\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":263},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/escalations","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalations","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"escalations-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 110","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nAn escalation is a workflow triggered by an escalation event.

For example:\n\n,type: scale_instances\ntarget: monarch  # Target cluster for the scale up/down.\n                 # If it's not specified, by default it's the \n                 # current cluster where SLA escalations are \n                 # specified.\nminimum: 1       # Minimum number of instances.\nmaximum: 3       # Maximum number of instances.\nscale_by: 1      # Increment/decrement to use on current \n                 # number of running instances.\nscale_cpu \nScales up the number of CPUs per instances. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version).  For example:\n\n,type: scale_cpu\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 1\nmaximum: 3 \nscale_by: 0.5\n scale_memory   \nScales up the memory per instance. It is applied only on the first service in the cluster (old or \"A\" version). For example:\n\n,type: scale_memory\ntarget: monarch  \nminimum: 512     # In MB.\nmaximum: 4096    # In MB.\nscale_by: 512    # In MB.\n\nComposing escalation handlers\n\nVamp has a set of predefined escalation handler types that deal with escalations. You can compose these handlers in the DSL to get the desired outcome of an escalation event. The escalation handlers toall and toone are supported:\n\n to_all  \nThis is a \"group\" escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to all escalation handlers from its list. No order or hierarchy. For example: \n \n,to_all:\n  escalations:\n    # Scale up/down.\n    scale_instances\n    # And notify for each event.\n    notify\nto_one  \nThis is a group escalation handler that contains a list of escalations. On each escalation event it will propagate the escalation to each escalation handler (from its list) until one can handle it. On an Escalate event, it will start at the head of the list. During a DeEscalate event is will start at the rear.  \nWhen is this useful? Well, Vamp could try to scale up the service and if that;s not possible anymore (e.g. reached the upper limit of allowed scale) then an email can be sent.  \n\nFor example, a simple use of to_one would be: \n\n,to_one:\n  escalations:\n     First try to escalate.\n    scale_instances\n    # If it's not possible, proceed with notifying.\n    notify\nA more complex use of to_one would be: \n\n,name: monarch\n\ngateways:\n  80: monarch1/port\n\nenvironment_variables:\n  monarch2.password: secret\n\nclusters:\n\n  monarch1:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch1\n      deployable: vamp/monarch1\n      ports:\n        port: 80/http\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_HOST: $storage.host\n        DB_PORT: $storage.ports.port\n        STORAGEPASS: $storage.environmentvariables.password\n      \n      dependencies:\n        storage: monarch2\n\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n    \n    sla:\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000\n        lower: 100\n      window:\n        interval: 600\n        cooldown: 600\n      escalations:\n        to_one:\n            escalations:\n              type: scale_instances\n                # First try to scale up storage service.\n                target: monarch2\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              type: scale_instances\n                # If we cannot scale up storage anymore, scale up this.\n                target: monarch1\n                minimum: 1\n                maximum: 3\n                scale_by: 1\n              \n  monarch2:\n    breed:\n      name: monarch2\n      deployable: vamp/monarch2\n      ports:\n        port: 3306\n      environment_variables:\n        STORAGE_PASS: password\n    scale:\n      cpu: 1\n      memory: 1024MB\n      instances: 1\n\n  \nRead about Vamp events\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":264},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/events","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Events","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"events-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 120","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nVamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events. Vamp collects events on all running services. Interaction with the API also creates events, like updating blueprints or deleting a deployment. Furthermore, Vamp allows third party applications to create events and trigger Vamp actions. All events are stored and retrieved using the Event API that is part of Vamp.\n\nExample - JSON \"deployment create\" event\n\n \n Storing events\nVamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch with a unique ID using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .\n\nBasic event rules\n\nAll events stick to some basic rules:\n\nAll data in Vamp are events. \nEvents consist of an event type, one or more event tags and an optional event value. They are described in the format ['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type \nEvent values can be empty or any JSON object.\nEvent timestamps are in ISO8601/RFC3339.\nTimestamps are optional. If not provided, Vamp will insert the current time.\nTimestamps are inclusive for querying.\nEvents can be tagged with metadata. A simple event tag is just single string.\nQuerying data by tag assumes \"AND\" behaviour when multiple tags are supplied, i.e. [\"one\", \"two\"] would only fetch records that are tagged with both.\nSupported event aggregations are: average, min, max and count.\nYou can create custom event types, names should only include alphanumerics, ‘_’ and ‘-’\n\n Event type\nVamp works with a number of default event types and custom event types can also be created using the /events API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type event will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.\n\nDefault event types |  Description\n----------|-----,Archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)\nSynchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)\nEvent | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event\nHealth | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nMetrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI\nAllocation | Generated by the allocation workflow used to calculate resource usage\nWorkflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner\n\nEvent value\nThe event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If no value is specified, it will be blank\n\n Event tags\nEach event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for stored events and are used for filtering searches and listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a :. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). generictag:specifictag\n\nHow tags are organised\n\nIn all of Vamp's components we follow a REST (resource oriented) schema, for instance:\n/deployments/  \n/deployments/ /clusters/ /services/ \nTagging is done using a very similar schema: \" \", \" : \". For example:\n\n[\n    \"deployments\", \n    \"deployments: \", \n    \"clusters\", \n    \"clusters: \", \n    \"services\", \n    \"services: \"\n]\n\nThis schema allows querying per group and per specific name. Getting all events related to all deployments is done by using tag \"deployments\". Getting events for specific deployment \"deployments: \".\n\n Query events using tags\n\nUsing the tags schema and timestamps, you can do some powerful queries. Either use an exact timestamp or use special range query operators, described on the elastic.co site (elastic.co - Range query).\n\n  \nthe default page size for a set of returned events is 30.\n  \n\nExample queries\n\nGet all events\nResponse time for a cluster\nCurrent sessions for a service\nAll known events for a service\n \n Example 1\nGet all events\n\nThe below query gets ALL metrics events up till now, taking into regard the pagination.\n\n  \nGET request with body - similar to approach used by Elasticsearch.\n  \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 2 \nResponse time for a cluster\n\nThe below query gets the most recent response time events for the \"frontend\" cluster in the \"d9b42796-d8f6-431b-9230-9d316defaf6d\" deployment.\n\nNotice the \"gateways:UUID\", \"metrics:responseTime\" and \"gateways\" tags. This means \"give me the response time of this specific gateway at the gateway level\". The response will echo back the events in the time range with the original set of tags associated with the events. \n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n[\n     ,\n     \n]    \n\n Example 3\nCurrent sessions for a service\n\nAnother example is getting the current sessions for a specific service, in this case the monarch_front:0.2 service that is part of the 214615ec-d5e4-473e-a98e-8aa4998b16f4 deployment and lives in the frontend cluster.\n\nNotice we made the search more specific by specifying the \"services\" and then \"service:SERVICE NAME\" tag.\nAlso, we are using relative timestamps: anything later or equal (lte) than \"now\".\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\nExample 4\nAll known events for a service\n\nThis below query gives you all the events we have for a specific service, in this case the same service as in example 2. In this way you can get a quick \"health snapshot\" of service, server, cluster or deployment.\n\nNotice we made the search less specific by just providing the \"metrics\" tag and not telling the API which specific one we want.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n Server-sent events (SSE)\n\nEvents can be streamed back directly from Vamp.\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream\n\nIn order to narrow down (filter) events, list of tags could be provided in the request body.\n\n \n\nGET method can be also used with tag parameter (may be more convenient):\n\nGET /api/v1/events/stream?tag=archiving&tag=breeds\n\nArchiving\n\nAll changes in artifacts (creation, update or deletion) triggered by REST API calls are archived. We store the type of event and the original representation of the artifact. It's a bit like a Git log. \n\nHere is an example event:\n\n \n\nSearching through the archive is 100% the same as searching for events. The same tagging scheme applies.\nThe following query gives back the last set of delete actions executed in the Vamp API, regardless of the artifact type.\n\nGET /api/v1/events\n\n \n \n\n  \nTry the tutorial Create a workflow that generates events\nRead about Vamp health\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":265},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/gateways","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Gateways","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"gateways-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 30","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nGateways are dynamic runtime entities in the Vamp eco-system defined by ports (incoming) and routes (outgoing). They represent load balancer rules to deployment, cluster and service instances. There are two types of Vamp gateway:\nGateways allows for programmable routing. \n\nInternal gateways created automatically for each deployment cluster and shared by all services deployed within it. Used to distribute traffic for canary releasing and A/B testing across service variants.\nExternal gateways  explicitly declared either in a deployment blueprint or using the gateways API. Provide a stable entry point to a defined, existing route or routes.\n\nEach gateway defines a set of rules for filtering and distributing traffic across the included routes and can optionally be set as sticky. You can access internal and external gateways through Vamp reverse proxy.\n\nOn this page:\n\nRoute weight and condition strength\nURL path rewrite\nVamp managed and external routes\n\n Route weight and condition strength\n\nEach route in a gateway has a weight and optionally one or more conditions with a condition_strength (used to target specific traffic for routing). Read more about conditions  \n\nRouting is calculated as followed:\n\nVamp will first check for a condition that matches the incoming request.   \n  for example, IOS users\nIf a matching condition is found, Vamp will check the condition_strength. The condition strength specifies the percentage of traffic matching the condition to target.  \n  for example, 10% of IOS\nFinally, if no matching condition was found or the request was not selected for routing based on the conditionstrength, it will be routed according to the route weight of all available routes.    \n  for example, all non-IOS traffic and 90% of IOS users are routed according to route weight\n\n  \nVamp has to account for all traffic.  \nWhen defining weights, the total weight of all routes must always add up to 100%.\nThis means that in a straight three-way split one service must be given 34% as 33%+33%+33%=99% - 1% can be a lot of traffic in high volume environments.\n  \n\nExample - Route all Firefox and only Firefox users to route service_B:\n\nservice_A:\n  weight: 100%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 0%\n  condition_strength: 100%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\n Example - Route half of Firefox users to serviceB, other half to serviceA (80%) or service_B (20%):\nNon Firefox requests will be just sent to serviceA (80%) or serviceB (20%).\nservice_A:\n  weight: 80%\nservice_B:\n  weight: 20%\n  condition_strength: 50%\n  condition: user-agent == Firefox\n\nExample - A/B test two deployments using route weight\nBelow is a basic example, similar to putting both deployments (sava:1.0.0 and sava:1.1.0) in the same cluster.  \nIt is easy to imagine having an older legacy application and the new one and doing a full canary release (or A/B testing) in seamless way by using gateways like this.\n\nDeployment 1: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.0\n\nname: sava:1.0\ngateways:\n  9050/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.0.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nDeployment 2: PUT /api/v1/deployments/sava:1.1\n\nname: sava:1.1\ngateways:\n  9060/http: sava/port\nclusters:\n  sava:\n    services:\n      breed:\n          name: sava:1.1.0\n          deployable: magneticio/sava:1.1.0\n          ports:\n            port: 8080/http\n            \n        scale:\n          cpu: 0.2\n          memory: 256MB\n          instances: 2\n\nGateway (90% / 10%): POST /api/v1/gateways\n\nname: sava\nport: 9070/http\nroutes:\n  sava:1.0/sava/port:\n    weight: 90%           condition can be used as well\n  sava:1.1/sava/port:\n    weight: 10%\n\nURL path rewrite\n\nVamp supports URL path rewrite. This can be a powerful solution in defining service APIs (e.g. RESTful) outside of application service.  Path rewrite is defined in the format path: NEW_PATH if CONDITION, where:\n\nNEW_PATH new path to be used; HAProxy variables are supported, e.g. %[path]\nCONDITION condition using HAProxy directives, e.g. matching path, method, headers etc.\n\n Example\nroutes:\n  web/port1:\n    rewrites:\n    path: a if b\n  web/port2:\n    weight: 100%\n\nVamp managed and external routes\n\nVamp managed routes are in the format:\n\ngateway - pointing to another gateway, e.g. it is possible to chain gateways\ndeployment/cluster - pointing to deployment cluster, i.e. services are not 'visible'\ndeployment/cluster/service - pointing to specific service within deployment cluster\n\nAll examples above cover only Vamp managed routes.\nIt is also possible to route traffic to specific IP or hostname and port.\nIn that case IP or hostname and port need to be specified between brackets, e.g. [hostname:port] (and double quotes due to Yaml syntax).\n\nname: mesos\nport: 8080/http\nsticky: route\n\nroutes:\n  \"[192.168.99.100:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n  \"[localhost:5050]\":\n    weight: 50%\n\n  \nRead about Vamp workflows\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":266},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/health","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Health","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"health-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 130","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nVamp tracks the health of deployed service instances and gateways.

For references, you use the reference keyword or its shorter version ref. Think of it like either using actual values or pointers to a value. This has a big impact on how complex or simple you can make any blueprint, breed or deployment. It also impacts how much knowledge you need to have of all the different artifacts that are used in a typical deployment or blueprint.\n\nVamp assumes that referenced artifcats (the breed called my_breed in the example below) is available to load from its datastore at deploy time.

(they do not include the standard api/v1/...)\n\n Host and port  \nYou can access a specific host and port at the following endpoint:\nvamp uri/proxy/host/ /port/ /\n    \nInternal or external gateway\nYou can access an exposed gateway (internal or external) at the following endpoint:\nvamp uri/proxy/gateways/ /\nExample - access sava 9050 gateway via Vamp reverse proxy\nAn external gateway that exposes port 9050 external gateway can be accessed through Vamp reverse proxy in the following ways:  \n\nthrough the API endpoint at the URL http://localhost:8080/proxy/gateways/sava%2F9050/\nin the Vamp UI: \n  Go to the Gateways page\n  Click on the gateway\n  Click the HOST - PORT/TYPE and you will be routed according to the defined rules.\n\n Deployment instance\nYou can access a specific instance of a deployment at the following endpoint:\nvamp uri/proxy/deployments/ /clusters/ /service/ /instances/ /ports/ \n\nWorkflow instance  \nYou can access a specific instance of a workflow at the following endpoint:\nvamp uri/proxy/workflows/ /instances/ /ports/ \n\n  \nRead about using Vamp for service discovery\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  ","id":269},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/service-discovery","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Service discovery","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"service-discovery-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 150","aliases":"aliases:","content":"Vamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent (microservices.io - server side discovery). In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry (microservices.io - service registry).\n\nFor Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:\n\nNo code injection needed.\nNo extra libraries or agents needed.\nplatform/language agnostic: it’s just HTTP.\nEasy integration using ENV variables.\n\nCreate and publish a service\n\n  \nServices do not register themselves. They are explicitly created, registered in the Vamp database and provisioned on the load balancer.\n  \n\nServices are created and published as follows:\n\nThe user describes a service and its desired endpoint port in the Vamp DSL.\nThe service is deployed to the configured container manager by Vamp.\nVamp instructs Vamp Gateway Agent (via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul) to set up service endpoints.\nVamp Gateway Agent takes care of configuring HAProxy, making the services available.\n\nAfter this, you can scale the service up/down or in/out either by hand or using Vamp’s auto scaling functionality. The endpoint is stable.\n\n Discovering a service\n\nSo, how does one service find a dependent service? Services are found by just referencing them in the DSL. Take a look at the following example:\n\nname: my_blueprint:1.0\nclusters:\n  myfrontendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: myfrontendservice:0.1\n        deployable: company/frontend:0.1\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        dependencies:\n          backend: mybackendservice:0.3\n        environment_variables:\n         BACKEND_HOST: $backend.host\n         BACKEND_PORT: $backend.ports.jdbc\n      scale:\n        instances: 3         \n  mybackendcluster:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: mybackendservice:0.3\n        deployable: company/backend:0.3\n        ports:\n          jdbc: 8080/tcp\n      scale:\n        instances: 4\n\nWe have a frontend cluster and a backend cluster. These are just organisational units.\nThe frontend cluster runs just one version of our service, consisting of three instances.\nThe frontend service has a hard dependency on a backend (tcp) service.\nWe reference the backend by name, my_backend:0.3, and assign it a label, in this case just backend\nWe use the label backend to get the host and a specific port (jdbc) from this backend.\nWe assign these values to environment variables that are exposed in the container runtime.\nAny frontend service now has access to the location of the dependent backend service.\n\nNote that there is no point-to-point wiring. The $backend.host and $backend.ports.jdbc variables resolve to service endpoints Vamp automatically sets up and exposes.\n\nEven though Vamp provides this type of service discovery, it does not put any constraint on other possible solutions. For instance services can use their own approach specific approach using service registry, self-registration etc.\n\nConfigure the gateway-driver\n\nThe gateway-driver section of the Vamp configuration file application.conf configures how traffic should be routed through Vamp Gateway Agent. See the below example on how to configure this:\n\nvamp  \n     \n   \n   \n\nThe reason for the need to configure vamp.gateway-driver.host is that when services are deployed, they need to be able to find Vamp Gateway Agent in their respective networks. This can be a totally different network than where Vamp is running.\nLet's use an example: frontend and backend service, frontend depends on backend - in Vamp DSL that would be 2 clusters (assuming the same deployment).\nThere are different ways how frontend can discover its dependency backend, and to make things simpler Vamp supports using specific environment parameters.\n\nname: my-web-app\nclusters:\n  frontend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-frontend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-frontend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n        environment_variables:\n          BACKEND: http://$backend.host:$backend.ports.port\n        dependencies:\n          backend: my-backend:1.0.0\n  backend:\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: my-backend:1.0.0\n        deployable: magneticio/my-backend:1.0.0\n        ports:\n          port: 8080/http\n\nIn this example $backend.host will have the value of the vamp.gateway-driver.host configuration parameter, while $backend.ports.port the next available port from vamp.operation.gateway.port-range.\nfrontend doesn't connect to backend directly but via Vamp Gateway Agent(s) - given on these host and port parameters.\nThis is quite simmilar to common pattern to access any clustered application.\nFor instance if you want to access DB server, you will have an address string based on e.g. DNS name or something simmilar.\nNote that even without Vamp, you would need to setup access to backend in some similar way.\nWith Vamp, access is via VGA's and that allows specific routing (conditions, weights) needed for A/B testing and canary releasing.\n\n  \nRead about Vamp SLAs (Service Level Agreements)\nCheck the API documentation\nTry Vamp\n  \n","id":270},{"path":"/documentation/using vamp/v0.9.5/sla","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"SLA (Service Level Agreement)","menu":"menu:","  main":" main:","    identifier":"   identifier: \"sla-v095\"","    parent":"   parent: \"Using Vamp\"","    weight":"   weight: 160","aliases":"aliases:","content":"\nSLA stands for \"Service Level Agreement\". Vamp uses it to define a pre-described set of boundaries to a service and the actions that should take place once the service crosses those boundaries. In essence, an SLA and its associated escalation is a workflow that is checked and controlled by Vamp based on the runtime behaviour of a service. SLAs and escalations are defined with the VAMP DSL.\n\nThe SLA event system\n\nYou can define an SLA for each cluster in a blueprint. A common example would be to check if the average response time of the cluster (averaged across all services) is higher or lower than a certain threshold. Under the hood, an SLA workflow creates two distinct events. These are are sent from Vamp and stored to Elasticsearch.\n\nEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is higher than the upper threshold.\nDeEscalate for a specific deployment and cluster  \ne.g. if the response time is lower than the lower threshold.\n\nSLA monitoring is a continuous background process with a configurable interval time. On each run an SLA workflow is executed for each deployment & cluster that has an SLA defined. Within the same SLA definition it's possible to define a list of escalations. Escalations are triggered by escalation events (Escalate/DeEscalate).\n\nThis means escalation events can be generated by the third party systems by sending them to Elasticsearch. This would allow scaling up or down to be triggered by basically any system that can POST a piece of JSON.\n\nSLA's are in essence pieces of code inside Vamp that stick to this event model and can use, if they want, the metrics and event data streaming out of Elasticsearch to make decisions on how things are and should be running.\n\n SLA types\n\nVamp currently ships with the following SLA types:\n\nresponsetimesliding_window\n\nResponse time with sliding window \n\nThe responsetimesliding_window SLA triggers events based on response times. \n\n Example - SLA defined inline in a blueprint.\n\nNotice the SLA is defined per cluster and acts on the first service in the cluster.\n\nNotice how the SLA is defined separately from the escalations. This is key to how Vamp approaches SLA's and how modular and extendable the system is.\n\nname: sava\n\ngateways:\n  80: sava/webport\n\nclusters:\n\n  sava:                        # the sava cluster\n    services:\n      breed:\n        name: monarch\n        deployable: vamp/monarch\n        ports:\n          webport: 80\n\n      scale:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1024MB\n        instances: 2\n\n    sla:                        # SLA applies to the first service in the sava cluster (monarch)\n      # Type of SLA.\n      type: responsetimesliding_window\n      threshold:\n        upper: 1000   # Upper threshold in milliseconds.\n        lower: 100    # Lower threshold in milliseconds.\n      window:\n        interval: 600 # Time period in seconds used for\n                      # average response time aggregation.\n        cooldown: 600 # Time period in seconds.

Using Vamp you can apply a canary release to introduce the new frontend to a selected cohort of users, browsers and/or devices. This would require a minimal investment of development and delivering real usage data:\n\nStart small: Build the new frontend for only one specific browser/resolution first to measure effectiveness. Vamp can deploy the new responsive frontend and route a percentage of supported users with this specific browser and screen-resolution there. All other users will continue to see the old version of your website.\nOptimise: With the new responsive frontend in the hands of real users with this specific browser/resolution, you can measure actual data and optimise accordingly without negatively affecting the majority of your users.\nScale up: Once you are satisified with the performance of the new frontend, you can use Vamp to scale up the release, developing and canary releasing one browser/resolution at a time.

A big bang style re-write to upgrade all components at once is a risky approach and requires a large investment in development, testing and refactoring.\n\nWhy not work incrementally? Using Vamp's routing you could introduce new services for specific application tiers like the frontend or business logic layers, and move traffic with specific conditions to these new services. These services in turn can connect to your legacy systems again, using Vamp's proxying. A typical example would be introducing an angular based frontend or node.js based API microservice. You can send 2% of your incoming traffic to this new microservice frontend, which in turn connects with the legacy backend system. This way you can test your new microservices in a small and controlled way and avoid a big bang release. You can introduce new services one by one, test them in production and increase traffic until you migrated your entire application from a monolith to microservices.\n\nStart small: You can build e.g. one new frontend component. Vamp will deploy this to run alongside the legacy monolithic system.\nActivate smart routing: Vamp can route traffic behind the scenes, so a small percentage of visitors is sent to the new frontend service, while the new frontend is routed by Vamp to the legacy backend. You can continue transferring components from the legacy monolithic system to new microservices and Vamp can adapt the routing as you go.\nRemove legacy components: Once all services have been transferred from the legacy monolith, you can start removing components from the legacy system.\n\n  \nRead about using Vamp to test and modernise architecture\nSee how Vamp measures up to common platforms, tools and frameworks  \nFind out how Vamp works\n  ","id":284},{"path":"/product/use-cases/resolve-incompatibilities-after-upgrade","date":"2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00","title":"Resolve client-side incompatibilities after an upgrade","menu":"menu:","    main":"   main: ","        parent":"       parent: \"Use cases\"","        name":"       name: \"Resolve incompatibilities\"","        weight":"       weight: 30","content":"\n “We upgraded our website self-management portal, but our biggest client is running an unsupported old browser version”\n  \nLeaving an important client unable to access your services after a major upgrade is a big and potentially costly problem. The traditional response would be to rollback the upgrade asap - if that's even possible.  \n\nWhy rollback? Using Vamp's smart conditional routing you could send specific clients or browser-versions to an older version of your portal while others can enjoy the benefits of your new upgraded portal. Because Vamp supports SLA based autoscaling for (Docker) containers, you can deploy the old version on the same infrastructure as the new version is running on. This also avoids having to provision costly over dimensioned DTAP environments for only a small user-base, leveraging your existing infrastructure efficiently.\n\nRe-deploy: Vamp can (re)deploy a (containerised) compatible version of your portal to run side-by-side with the upgraded version.\nActivate smart routing: Vamp can route all users with e.g. a specific IP, browser or location to a compatible version of the portal.

It's also easy to create advanced workflows for up and down scaling, based on your application or business specific requirements. Vamp can also make sure that unhealthy and failing services are corrected based on clearly defined metrics and treshholds.\n\nSet SLAs: You can define SLA metrics, tresholds and escalation workflows.

Stress tests rarely cater to extreme real world circumstances and usage patterns, and are often done on systems that are not identical to production environments. It's not uncommon the bottleneck sits in the system generating the load itself, so it's difficult to predict how your microservices would actually scale or to know if your planned responses will really help.\n\nWhy not find out for sure? Using Vamp you can test your services and applications against difficult to predict or simulate situations, mocking all kinds of metrics, and then validate and optimise the workflows that handle the responses, like for example auto up and down scaling. With the same workflows as would be running in production, on the same infrastructure, with the same settings.\n\nMock required load: Vamp can simulate (mock) high-stress situations for any kind of metric your system needs to respond to, without actually having to generate real traffic.\nOptimise: You can optimise your resource allocation and autoscaling configurations based on real validated behaviour under stress.\nIterate until you're certain: Vamp can repeat the tests until you're confident with the outcome.

Vamp integrates with CI/CD tools like Travis, Jenkins or Wercker to canary-release and scale the built deployables they provide. The initial deployment setup is defined in a YAML blueprint (e.g. deployable details, required resources, routing filters) and is typically provided by the CI tool as a template to the Vamp API. Vamp will then run, canary-release, monitor and scale the deployment based on the filters and conditions specified in the blueprint.\n\n Vamp compared to feature toggle frameworks\nLaunchDarkly, Togglz, Petri  \nFeature toggle frameworks use code level feature toggles to conditionally test new functionality in an application or service. Tools such as LaunchDarkly and Togglz work with these toggles to enable, for example, A/B testing and canary functionality. While there are many cases for using feature toggles, there are also times when feature toggling isn't the smartest choice.\nVamp allows controlled testing of new features without the need to adjust your code. To achieve this, Vamp controls traffic routing towards and between your applications and services based on blueprint descriptions of individual (micro)services and their dependencies. This makes sense on an application code level, offering increased security and reduced technical debt compared to maintaining toggles in your code, and provides a mature alternative for cases when feature toggles are not the appropriate choice.\n\nVamp compared to configuration management and provisioning tools\nPuppet, Ansible, Chef, Terraform    \nThe responsbilities of configuration management and infrastructure provisioning tools are often stretched to cover container deployment features. These tools were not intended for handling container deployments or for the dynamic management and routing traffic over these containers. Vamp has been designed and developed from the ground up specifically to fit these use cases.  \n\n Vamp compared to custom built solutions\nBuilding and maintaining a scalable and robust enterprise-grade system for canary-testing and releasing is not trivial. Vamp delivers programmable routing and automatic load balancing, deployment orchestration and workflows, as well as a powerful event system, REST API, graphical UI, integration testing tools and a CLI.  \n\nVamp compared to A/B and MVT testing tools\nOptimizely, VisualWebsiteOptimizer, Google Analytics, Planout  \nVamp enables canary testing versions of applications, effectively providing A/B and MVT testing of applications and services by deploying two or more versions of an application or service and dividing incoming traffic between the running versions. Vamp doesn't have a built-in analytics engine though, so the analysing of the relevant metrics needs to be done with a specific Vamp workflow or an external analytics engine. Results can be fed back to Vamp to automatically update routing rules and deployments to push a winning version to a full production release. Because of the flexible programmable routing and use of environment variables, Vamp can be used to canary test almost everything, from content and business logic to configuration settings and architectural changes.  \n\n Vamp compared to DevOps tools\nDeis, Flynn, Dokku  \nVamp has no ambition to provide a Heroku-like environment for containers. Vamp integrates programmable routing and load balancing, container deployments and orchestration to enable canary testing and canary releasing features.
