Thank you for your interest in Vamp Enterprise! To start using Vamp Enterprise you need to setup and configure some dependencies and environments. To make this really easy we&amp;rsquo;ve created Vamp Lifter, our setup and configuration tool. You can read more about Vamp components, including Lifter here.

      <description>This section describes how to quickly install Vamp 1.0 on Kubernetes so you can evaluate it. The installation uses an installer built into the Vamp Lifter application to bootstrap a full Vamp installation.
After a successful installation, you will be able to login to Vamp EE as an admin user and deploy services.
Note!
Do not run this default installation in production! It does not include persistent storage and makes use of a Hashicorp Vault &amp;lsquo;dev&amp;rsquo; server.</description>
