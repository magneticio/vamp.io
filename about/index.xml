      <description>1 Build revolutionarily Put your efforts towards creating the stuff that doesnâ€™t exist yet. The rest we can just buy, borrow, fork or clone.
2 Don&amp;rsquo;t predict, be reactive Nobody really knows what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen, so react to whatever comes your way.
3 Compose with microservices Monolithic has been dead for a while. Keep it that way.
4 Faster is always better The millisecond is the new second. Especially on mobile.</description>
