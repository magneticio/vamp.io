    content: "Wether you are considering adopting container technology or already deploy multiple daily releases of your containerised
             applications in the cloud, managing the stack and business expectations present daunting challenges. Vamp overcomes these challenges.
             To get you up and running with Vamp, we created the Vamp discovery pilot program: a guided, 90 day hands-on program where
             we help you get all the benefits of Vamp on your environment and infrastructure."
