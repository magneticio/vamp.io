personas:
    persona1:
        quote: "Releasing new versions of services is done manually, error-prone and DevOps resources are scarce. Testing a release takes more time than we have. As business demands keep coming we suffer from release anxiety, rollbacks are costly and complex. "
    persona2:
        quote: "We've just released an improved version of our customer subscription API, but I'm not sure if it actually performs better, and now I'm also seeing issues appearing in other related services. What's going on?"
    persona3:
        quote: "We use our own tools to manage microservice lifecycles, but now our platform and services are growing rapidly. We need to increase velocity and reduce the amount of failed deployments to keep up. I want an automated, scalable and future proof solution for all DevOps teams to support our growth."
