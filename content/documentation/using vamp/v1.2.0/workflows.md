Vamp workflows are a convenient way to run Node JS based scripts that access the Vamp API to monitor and interact with running services. JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent)) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. Workflows can be scheduled to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times.

Vamp ships with four default workflows:

- Health - checks and stores the status of running services. Events stored by the health workflow are used by the Vamp UI.
- Metrics - stores metrics on running services. Events stored by the metrics workflow are used by the Vamp UI.
- Kibana - supports the easy creation of Kibana dashboards.
- Allocation - calculates resource usage (CPU, memory)

The following breeds are required by system workflows and should not be deleted: allocation, health, kibana, metrics, vamp-workflow-javascript

## Track running workflows

You can track executions of a running workflow in the Vamp UI. From the **Workflows** page, click on a workflow port to open the execution list. Click on a specific execution to open its log.

## Create a workflow

Workflows can be created using Node JS based scripts running inside a Vamp workflow agent container, or use another language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a Docker container to be deployed by Vamp.
Vamp tracks all revisions made to workflows and breeds, so you can check back and compare the current version against a previous version.

Try it yourself: [Create a workflow that generates events](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-workflow/)

### Workflow schedules

You can schedule a workflow to run as a daemon, be triggered by specific events or run according to a time schedule. See the examples for each below.

- **Scheduled as a daemon**
  A workflow scheduled as a daemon will run continuously.

  ```
  schedule: daemon
  ```

- **Triggered by events**

```
schedule:
  event: # event with following tags will trigger the workflow
  - deployments:sava
  - cluster:runner

schedule:  # shortened notation in case of single event (still array can be used as above)
  event: archive:bluprints
```

- **Scheduled by time**
  `period`, `start` (optional, by default starts now) and `repeat` (optional, by default runs forever). The time schedule period is in [ISO8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) repeating interval notation.
  For example:

```
schedule:
  time:
    period: P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S
    start: now # or e.g. start: 2016-12-03T08:15:30Z
    repeat: 10
```

### Workflow dialects

You can use dialects to specify native commands for the underlying container platform in a workflow.
[Read more about Vamp dialects](/documentation/using-vamp/v1.0.0/dialects/)

## JavaScript workflows

JavaScript workflows are executed by Vamp Workflow Agent ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent)). The system breed **vamp-workflow-javascript** is used to apply the standard enviroment variables, health checks and exposed ports.
Instructions for using JavaScript to access the Vamp API can be found in the Vamp Node Client project ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp node client](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-node-client)).

### Example: Metrics workflow and breed

The below examples show a JavaScript workflow with a separately stored JavaScript breed. All additional environment variables, health checks, ports and scale will be added from the **vamp-workflow-javascript** breed.

```
name    : metrics
breed   : metrics
schedule: daemon
environment_variables:
  VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_PERIOD:  5
  VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT: 7
```

The JavaScript breed referenced in the metrics workflow will be executed by Vamp Workflow Agent ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent)).
You could create a Javascript breed by sending the required JavaScript directly to the API to store as a breed:

- Request syntax:

```
PUT
/api/v1/breeds/metrics
Content-Type: application/javascript
```

- Request body:

```
'use strict';

let _ = require('highland');
let vamp = require('vamp-node-client');

let api = new vamp.Api();
let logger = new vamp.Log();
let metrics = new vamp.ElasticsearchMetrics(api);

let window = 30; // seconds

function publish(tags, metrics) {
  logger.log('metrics: [' + JSON.stringify(tags) + '] - ' + metrics);
  api.event(tags, metrics, 'metrics');
}

api.gateways().each(function (gateway) {

  metrics.average({ft: gateway.lookup_name}, 'Tt', window).each(function (response) {
    publish(['gateways:' + gateway.name, 'gateway', 'metrics:rate'], response.rate);
    publish(['gateways:' + gateway.name, 'gateway', 'metrics:responseTime'], response.average);
  });

  api.namify(gateway.routes).each(function (route) {
    metrics.average({ft: route.lookup_name}, 'Tt', window).each(function (response) {
      publish(['gateways:' + gateway.name, 'routes:' + route.name, 'route', 'metrics:rate'], response.rate);
      publish(['gateways:' + gateway.name, 'routes:' + route.name, 'route', 'metrics:responseTime'], response.average);
    });
  });
});
```
