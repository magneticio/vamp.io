Conditions are used by gateways to filter incoming traffic for routing between services in a cluster.
Read more about [gateway usage](/documentation/using-vamp/v1.0.0/gateways/#gateway-usage). You can define conditions inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name on the `/conditions` endpoint and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint.

#### Example - simple inline condition

This would be used directly inside a blueprint.

```yaml
---
condition_strength: 10% # Amount of traffic for this service in percents.
condition: User-Agent = IOS
```

## Create a condition

Creating conditions is quite easy. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible.
Under the hood, Vamp uses Haproxy's ACL's ([cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv - 7.1 ACL basics](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#7.1)) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the `condition` field of a condition.

However, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient "short codes"
to address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:

| description           |              syntax              |          example           |
| --------------------- | :------------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| match user agent      |     `user-agent ==` _value_      |  `user-agent == Firefox`   |
| mismatch user agent   |     `user-agent !=` _value_      |  `user-agent != Firefox`   |
| match host            |        `host ==` _value_         |    `host == localhost`     |
| mismatch host         |        `host !=` _value_         |    `host != localhost`     |
| has cookie            |       `has cookie` _value_       |     `has cookie vamp`      |
| misses cookie         |     `misses cookie` _value_      |    `misses cookie vamp`    |
| has header            |       `has header` _value_       |     `has header ETag`      |
| misses header         |     `misses header` _value_      |    `misses header ETag`    |
| match cookie value    |  `cookie` _name_ `has` _value_   |  `cookie vamp has 12345`   |
| mismatch cookie value | `cookie` _name_ `misses` _value_ | `cookie vamp misses 12345` |
| header has value      |  `header` _name_ `has` _value_   |  `header vamp has 12345`   |
| header misses value   | `header` _name_ `misses` _value_ | `header vamp misses 12345` |

Vamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:

In order to specify plain HAProxy ACL, ACL needs to be between `{ }`:

```yaml
condition: "< hdr_sub(user-agent) Chrome >"
```

Having multiple conditions in a condition is perfectly possible. For example, the following condition would first check whether the string "Chrome" exists in the User-Agent header of a
request and then it would check whether the request has the header
"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER". So any request matching both conditions would go to this service.

```yaml
---
gateways:
  weight: 100%
  condition: "User-Agent = Chrome AND Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER"
```

Using a tool like httpie ([github.com/jkbrzt/httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie)) makes testing this a breeze.

    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff

### Boolean expression in conditions

Vamp supports `AND`, `OR`, negation `NOT` and grouping `( )`:

```yaml
---
gateways:
  weight: 100%
  condition: (User-Agent = Chrome OR User-Agent = Firefox) AND has cookie vamp
```
