## Getting started
We’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints that demonstrate Vamp’s core features - together we call them “Sava”. Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case they are examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

You can work with Sava in the [Kubernetes Quickstart](/documentation/installation/v1.0.0/kubernetes/) setup (or any other [Vamp installation](documentation/installation/v1.0.0/overview/)).

### Basic Concepts
1. [Deploy your first blueprint](/documentation/tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
2. [Run a canary release](/documentation/tutorials/run-a-canary-release/)
3. [Split a monolith into services](/documentation/tutorials/split-a-monolith/)
4. [Merge a changed topology](/documentation/tutorials/merge-and-delete/)

### Working with micro-services

In these tutorials we will be using a fictitious e-commerce application to highlight best practices for using Vamp in real world micro-service projects.

5. [Smarter releasing on Kubernetes](/documentation/tutorials/smarter-releasing-on-kubernetes/)
