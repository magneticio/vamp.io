## Getting started
We’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints that demonstrate Vamp’s core features - together we call them “Sava”. Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.
You can work with Sava in the [Vamp hello world](/documentation/installation/hello-world/) setup (or any other Vamp installation).

1. [Deploy your first blueprint](/documentation/tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
2. [Run a canary release](/documentation/tutorials/run-a-canary-release/)
3. [Split a monolith into services](/documentation/tutorials/split-a-monolith/)
4. [Merge a changed topology](/documentation/tutorials/merge-and-delete/)
