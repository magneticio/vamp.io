## Architecture
Vamp's architecture consists of several components that work together to deliver canary releasing, microscaling and other valueable release and runtime optimisation and automation workflows. The main components of Vamp are Vamp "core" (the brains), Vamp Gateway Agent (creating an ingress and intra-service mesh based on reverse proxies) and Vamp Workflow Agent (running automation scripts injected in containers managed by Vamp).

Vamp is a JVM application and is typically deployed as a Docker container inside your container cluster where Vamp will bootstrap it's dependency containers.

Vamp and the Vamp Gateway Agent require specific components in your architecture to handle orchestration (like a database for persistence data, a key-value store for proxy configurations, and elasticsearch for aggregated metrics). There is no set architecture required for running Vamp and every use case or specific combination of tools and platforms can have its own set up.

### Example topology
The below diagram should be used more as an overview than required architecture. For example, in this diagram the Mesos/Marathon stack and Elasticsearch are included even though these are not a hard dependency and can be replaced by f.e. Kubernetes as a container-scheduler and cluster-manager and in-memory for aggregated metrics. Vamp can be configured to run with other container schedulers, log-aggregators, key-value and event-stores.

## Vamp components

Vamp consists of server- and client-side components that work together with elements in your architecture to handle orchestration, routing, persistence and metrics aggregation.


### Vamp UI  
The Vamp UI is a graphical web interface for managing Vamp in a web browser. It is packaged with Vamp.

### Vamp CLI  
The Vamp CLI is a command line interface for managing Vamp and providing integration with (shell) scripts. It's currently not very well maintained but still can be useful if our REST API cannot be used for your integration requirements.

### Vamp  
Vamp is the main API endpoint, business logic and service coordinator. Vamp talks to the configured container manager (Docker, Marathon, Kubernetes etc.) and synchronizes it with Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  via ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul (distributed key-value stores). Vamp can use a SQL database or Elasticsearch for artifact persistence and Elasticsearch to store events (e.g. changes in deployments). Typically, there should be one Vamp instance and one or more VGA instances (we conform to the AirBnB Smartstack pattern). Vamp is not a realtime application and only updates deployments and routing when asked to (reactive) and thus doesn't need to run with multiple instances in HA mode. If this is a hard requirement of your project please contact us for the [Vamp Enterprise Edition](/why-use-vamp/enterprise-edition/).

### Vamp workflows
Vamp workflows are small applications or scripts (for example using (Node.js) JavaScript or your own containers that access the Vamp API) that automate and optimise the deployment and runtime of your system that consists of applications and services running inside containers. We have included a set of useful workflows out of the box, such as health and metrics, which are used by the Vamp UI to report system status and to enable autoscaling and self-healing. Our [Vamp Runner project](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-runner/) provides more advanced workflow recipes as an example.

### Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)  
Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) uses confd to read the Vamp-generated HAProxy configuration from ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul and reloads HAProxy on each configuration change with as close to zero client request interruptions as possible. Typically, there is one Vamp instance and one VGA instances on every cluster-node.
Logs from HAProxy are read by Filebeat and shipped to Elasticsearch. VGA will handle and recover from ZooKeeper, etcd and Consul outages without interrupting the HAProxy process and client requests.
