Vamp is an open source, self-hosted platform for managing (micro)service oriented architectures that rely on container
 technology. Vamp provides a DSL to describe services, their dependencies and required runtime environments in blueprints 
 and a runtime/execution engine to deploy these blueprints (similar to AWS Cloudformation). 
 Planned deployments and running services can be managed from your choice of Vamp interface - graphical UI, command line 
 interface or RESTful API.

Vamp takes care of route updates, metrics collection and service discovery, so you can easily orchestrate complex 
deployment patterns, such as architecture level A/B testing and canary releases.
After deployment, Vamp workflows monitor running applications and can act automatically based on defined SLAs.
