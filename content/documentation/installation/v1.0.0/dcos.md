This section describes how to quickly install Vamp 1.0 on DC/OS so you can evaluate it. The installation uses an installer built into the Vamp Lifter application to bootstrap a full Vamp installation.

After a successful installation, you will be able to login to Vamp EE as an admin user and deploy services. 

{{< note title="Note!" >}}
**Do not run this default installation in production!** It does not include persistent storage and makes use of a [Hashicorp Vault 'dev' server](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/dev-server.html).
