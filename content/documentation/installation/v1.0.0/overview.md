Before you get Vamp up and running on your architecture, it is helpful to understand [how vamp works](/documentation/how-vamp-works/concepts-and-components) and the role of each component and its preferred location in a typical deployment model.

#### Requirements

* [Vamp requirements](/documentation/how-vamp-works/requirements)

#### Vamp quickstart installation
As the name suggests, quickstart guides you through a few simple steps to deploys an evaluation version of Vamp. **Quickstart uses an [all-in-one cluster model](/documentation/how-vamp-works/v1.0.0/deployment-models/#all-in-one-cluster-model) that is only suitable for evaluating Vamp**. 

* [Kubernetes](/documentation/installation/kubernetes)
* [DC/OS](/documentation/installation/dcos)
