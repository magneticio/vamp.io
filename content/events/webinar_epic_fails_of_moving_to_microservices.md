For many organizations, a move to a microservices architecture holds a lot of promise of increased velocity and
time-to-value in their application environment. But they quickly find that complexity across their environment stacks.

In this webinar, we unpack the real-world issues of organizations making the journey to cloud-native and how you can
avoid - or resolve them!

We look at:

- best practice considerations around how to avoid "mini monoliths"
- the roadblocks you encounter when you overprioritize up-front testing
- how you can safely test-in-production by relying on technical and business KPIs

Join our Head of Customer Engineering, Jason Griffin, as he unpacks the real-life advice he and our team share with organizations facing these issues every day.
