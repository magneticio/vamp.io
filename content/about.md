title: about us
---
Vamp is being developed by Magnetic.io from the heart of beautiful [Amsterdam](http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/).  

We’re dedicated to helping organisations and companies of all sizes increase efficiency, save time and reduce costs.
We provide powerful and easy-to-use solutions to optimise modern architectures and systems, often based around microservices and/or containers.

## Vision
Time is precious. We believe people should focus their efforts on the things they excel at and that matter to them. Let computers do the repeatable and automatable tasks - they’re far more suited to that than we are. Smart automation FTW!

## Community
We encourage anyone to [join the Vamp community](/resources/community/) and pitch in with pull requests, bug reports and feature requests to make Vamp even more awesome.

## Working at Vamp
We're alway on the lookout for smart, talented and motivated people that love to work on products and understand real-world problems and how to solve them in the best possible way. If you would love to join our team and work on Vamp and related products, please get in [touch](/contact/)!
