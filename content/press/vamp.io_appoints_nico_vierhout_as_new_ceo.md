At Vamp.io, he will focus on the
international expansion of the company. Co-founder Olaf Molenveld
will assume the CTO role and focus on product and tech
vision.


Vamp.io develops and delivers enterprise
software that allows companies to control the roll-out and runtime
performance of microservice-based applications on both cloud and
on-premises environments. In addition, this software helps to
optimize these processes. After three years of developing open
source canary releasing software and auto scaling for
microservices, Vamp.io is about to launch an enterprise edition in
2018.


Molenveld, co-founder & CTO of
VAMP.io: “I am extremely proud that we have been able to take
Vamp.io to the next level. After we saw real traction for our
software with Fortune 500 companies from Asia to Europe and the US
over the last eighteen months, we knew that scaling our
organization would be the next challenge. And that is exactly what
we will do in the coming months, with Nico onboard. We are very
happy to have a seasoned professional in our management team and
are looking forward to benefit from Nico’s expertise and
experience, as we move forward.”


Vierhout: “It is Vamp’s challenge to
bring enterprises that started with cloud native implementations to
the next level of BizDevOps maturity. Then, they can truly reap the
benefits of extremely short-cycled innovations and get business and
DevOps on the same page to smartly deploy software to customers.
Vamp.io’s software has revolutionized the way companies develop and
deploy software by optimizing software releases and lifecycle
management and adding smarts such as auto scaling and customer
success parameters. Based on these data, Vamp ensures realtime
decisions with which the software roll-out is automatically
adjusted to customers and customer segments.”


Vamp’s canary releasing platform was
released as an open source solution three years ago.Vamp
collaborates with  enterprises worldwide, including Microsoft,
Mesosphere, ING, Rabobank, NFM, Exact.com, Huawei andZiggo/Liberty
Global. Current investor Volta Ventures has injected new capital to
scale up the company and boost the onboarding of enterprise
clients.
