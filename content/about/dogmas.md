## 1 Build revolutionarily

Put your efforts towards creating the stuff that doesnâ€™t exist yet. The rest we can just buy, borrow, fork or clone.

## 2 Don't predict, be reactive

Nobody really knows what's going to happen, so react to whatever comes your way.

## 3 Compose with microservices

Monolithic has been dead for a while. Keep it that way.

## 4 Faster is always better

The millisecond is the new second. Especially on mobile.

## 5 Ride the wave and make it bigger

Useful and cool stuff is released all the time. Use it and contribute to it.

## 6 New is hard, but that's OK

Some things don't have patterns, references or best practices yet. Don't be afraid to coin them.

## 7 Easy can be complex

Some things are complex by nature. The challenge is making them look simple. That's even more complex. Nice!

## 8 Use what works

Ignore religious debates about tools, languages and platforms. They will eat your happiness and confidence.

## 9 Do full stack UI & UX

API's, CLI's, manual pages and admin screens also need a proper UI and UX.

## 10 Don't be a stranger

It's 2018: Brazil, India and China are just around the corner. Use I18N.
