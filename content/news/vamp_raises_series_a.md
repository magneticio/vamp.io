The new capital injection will accelerate the development of features in the areas of service-meshes like Istio, serverless, 
machine-learning/AI and easy on-boarding. These additions will help Vamp.io’s clients fast-track their release management 
process by making it easier to deliver software to production and optimise time-to-value.

by saying, “With its eye on the future of cloud-native business innovation, Vamp.io is a great fit with our mission to 
support Benelux-headquartered growth-stage companies. Vamp.io made impressive progress on the product and commercial side 
over the last twelve months; we look forward to working with Nico and his team.

Vamp.io CEO Nico Vierhout echoed these sentiments and looked to the future by adding: “This investment round led by Vortex 
confirms the clear vision Vamp.io started with four years ago. Vamp.io fulfils the promise of a cloud-native tomorrow 
today by adding simplicity, controls and validation of new software intoproduction on cloud – something that’s crucial
