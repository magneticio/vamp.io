Come with us on a journey through time and space as Vamp explores what DevOps maturity anno 2025 might look like at this 
year's KubeCon 2019. You might be on roll or just getting started on your journey to cloud-native with tools like Kubernetes and crew. 
At Vamp, we get it – it’s cool, but complex.

Your engineering teams might already be overworked at DevOps maturity 0 or 1, so why are we talking about DevOps maturity 
‘the space age’? Because the future is coming and it’s a bright, shiny CI/CD pipeline powered by machine-learning.  

We’ve tinkered with the CD tech long enough to create a way of releasing microservices fast and frequently without 
crashing your whole dependency ecosystem.   
The key is smart canary-releasing. But what happens when you add data models 
into the go-to production mix? Well, our engineers are confident that what happens isn’t panic; but a smooth 
continuous-delivery process of ML models.

Join us at this year’s KubeCon for [A Tale of Two Worlds: Canary-Testing for Both ML Models and Microservices](https://kccnceu19.sched.com/event/MPau/a-tale-of-two-worlds-canary-testing-for-both-ml-models-and-microservices-jorg-schad-mesosphere-vincent-lesierse-vampio) as Mesosphere’s 
technical lead Jörg Schad teams up with our very own technical product manager Vincent Lesierse for the most integrated 
of mash-ups.
