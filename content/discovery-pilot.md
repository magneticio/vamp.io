## What is the Vamp Discovery Pilot?

Wether you are considering adopting container technology or already deploy multiple daily releases of your containerised 
applications in the cloud, managing the stack and business expectations presents a daunting challenge. Vamp automates many of these challenges. 

To get you up and running with Vamp, we created the Vamp discovery pilot program: a guided, 90 day hands-on program where 
we help you get all the benefits of Vamp on your environment and infrastructure. We ask a fee in return for our services 
which may be redeemed for Vamp Enterprise Edition licenses should you decide to implement Vamp permanently.
