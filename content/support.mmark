| Major impact            | The Software is inoperable or the performance of the Software is so severely reduced that Licensee cannot reasonably continue to operate the Software because of the Error and the Error cannot be circumvented with a Workaround. |
| Moderate impact         | The Software's performance is significantly degraded such that Licensee's use of the Software as permitted is materially impaired, but the Error can be circumvented with a Workaround.                                            |
| Minor impact            | Licensee is experiencing a performance, operational, or functional Error that can be circumvented with Workaround and the Error causes only minimal impact to the Licensee's ability to use the Software as authorized.            |
