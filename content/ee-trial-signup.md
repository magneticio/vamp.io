There are two ways to get started with a Vamp Enterprise trial.



## 1. Install yourself and try for 30 days

Install a free Vamp Enterprise trial version for 30 days yourself. Choose this option if you want to try Vamp Enterprise in
your own environment on your cluster. After completing the form you will receive a confirmation per email including a link where you can download the Vamp Enterprise trial version.

## 2. Request a guided test-drive 

The easiest way to start with Vamp Enterprise is in a free test-drive, guided and hosted by Vamp on our environment for 15 days. Use this option if you want to test-drive the use cases of Vamp, without the hassle of installing and configuring. After completing the form you will receive a confirmation per email. 

We will then contact you personally shortly afterwards to set-up an initial conversation with one of our engineers to kick-off the test-drive and show the basics of operating Vamp.

After the initial conversation, if you like what you hear then you can access a longer test-drive with some of your own microservices if you wish. This works best if you have two services with a dependency. It could be a front-end service and a backend service or two backend services.
