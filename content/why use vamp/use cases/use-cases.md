The integrated deployment, routing and workflow features of Vamp support a broad range of scenarios and industry verticals. We specifically see powerful use cases in the areas of testing in production, migrating to microservices, and realtime system optimisation. In this section we describe specific scenarios and how Vamp can effectively solve these.

#### Testing in production 
* Use canary testing and releasing to introduce a responsive web frontend. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/create-responsive-website/)
* Resolve client-side incompatibilities after an upgrade. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/resolve-incompatibilities-after-upgrade/)
* A/B test architectural changes in production. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/modernise-architecture/)

#### Migrating to microservices
* Move from VM based monoliths to modern microservices. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/refactor-monolithic-to-microsystems/)

#### Realtime system optimisation

* What would happen if...... Simulate and test auto scaling behaviour. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/simulate-and-test-scaling-behaviour)
* Self-healing and self-optimising. [Read more ...](/why-use-vamp/use-cases/self-healing-and-self-optimising)
