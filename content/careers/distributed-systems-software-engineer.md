# Java/Scala distributed systems software developer

## About the role

You have professional experience with JVM and functional programming (Java, Scala etc.) based development and tooling. You have experience with application development using “cloud-native” technologies (like Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon, ElasticSearch, Prometheus, HAProxy, NGINX, Terraform, microservices, Akka) and cloud infrastructure.

Your ambition is to be a true software crafts(wo)man, and thus you are aiming for the perfect balance between elegance and pragmatism, focusing on quality and maintainability. DevOps tickles your fancy. 

You love coming into work and enjoy the people you work with. You love making quality software! You are quick to pick up on new stuff and enjoy the process of learning new things.
